<p class="drop-cap">WHO has ever occupied
himself
seriously with the
investigation of the “night-side of Nature,”
or studied the works of Theophrastus
Paracelsus, and not become acquainted with
the celebrated “Untersberg” (the “mountain
of the lower world”) and its mysterious
inhabitants, the fairies and gnomes?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Like a gigantic outpost of the Austrian Alps,
this snow-capped wing of the mountains
stands on the frontier of Germany, overlooking
the Bavarian plains, dotted with hills,
forests, and lakes. Its summit, dwelling
above the clouds, dominates the valley
through which the Salzach river winds its
way to the Inn and the Danube. Seen from
the north side, where the city of Salzburg is
nestled among the hills, the mountain looks
tame enough, rising in undulating forest-covered
lines up to a height of some seven
thousand feet; but on the south side it exhibits
an almost endless variety of perpendicular
walls, formed of marble rocks thousands
of feet high, and interrupted by deep
ravines and chasms, craggy cliffs, spurs, and
precipices, over which in the time of spring,
when the snow begins to melt, great avalanches
come thundering down, and a sharp
eye may detect in many an inaccessible spot
mysterious caves, that seem to penetrate into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the bowels of that mysterious mountain. If
you will take the trouble of climbing up to
these dizzy heights, you will find yourself in
a new world, for there the Untersberg appears
not as one single mountain, but as a
mountain chain, of which each separate link
has its special aspect and character, being
separated from its neighbour by deep chasms,
through which the mountain streams rush.
There is no end of waterfalls, caves and
labyrinths of boulders, where the inexperienced
wanderer may lose his way, especially
if he is misled by the gnomes—which may
easily occur if his intentions are not pure.</p>

<p>The Untersberg is known to be inhabited
by certain kinds of elemental spirits of Nature,
some of which are good and benevolent, others
of a wicked and malicious nature, and inimical
to mankind; and there are innumerable tales
circulating among the people in the neighbourhood,
telling about the doings of the
gnomes, fairies, wild women, and giants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
dwelling within caves and in gorgeous
marble halls and grottoes filled with gold and
precious stones that will turn into dead leaves
and stones when seen in the light of day.
Some of the friendly tribes come out of the
Untersberg on certain occasions, and they are
said to have sometimes associated with the
inhabitants of our plane of existence, partaking
in the dances and amusements of the
peasants, and even taking stray children with
them into the Untersberg; and, incredible as it
may appear, it is even asserted by “those who
know” that marriages have taken place between
citizens of our world and the inhabitants
of the kingdom of gnomes, and that
these spirits of Nature, being themselves not
immortal, seek to obtain immortality by their
union with immortal man. The majority of
the gnomes, therefore, also love plain, truthful,
and unsophisticated human beings, such
as possess a soul in which the light of the
immortal spirit may be perceived, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
these they are ready to associate; but with
soulless beings, such as sophisticated, sceptical,
arrogant, short-sighted and opinionated scientists,
whose hearts are dead, and whose brains
are swollen with the products of their own
fancy, they will have nothing to do; to such
they never show themselves, but love to play
tricks upon them whenever they come with a
view of invading their kingdom.</p>

<p>Of course it is known to everybody that
within the mysterious depths of the Untersberg
there dwells the soul of a great emperor
in his astral form. There, together with his
retinue, he sleeps an enchanted sleep, waiting
for the liberation of his country. Sometimes
very suddenly, even on a clear summer day,
clouds are seen to issue from the sides of the
mountain; grotesquely-formed ghost-like mists
arise from caverns and precipices, crawling
and gliding slowly upwards toward the top,
and from the neighbouring peaks also clouds
of monstrous shapes and sometimes of gigantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
proportions come floating on, until the head
of the Untersberg is surrounded by a surging
sea of vapours growing dense and dark. Then
a clap of thunder reverberates through the
rocks, awakening hundreds of echoes, and
forked streaks of lightning flash down into
the valley; the storm-king arises, howling
dismally through the forest, breaking down
old trees and hurling them into the precipices
below. On such occasions the people in the
valleys piously make the sign of the cross, and
whisper to each other: “The great emperor
has awakened and is reviewing his troops.
He is angry because he sees that the black
ravens are still flying around the top of the
Untersberg.” This, of course, I hold to be a
fable, and the “emperor in the Untersberg”
is well known to the wise; but as to the dark
birds referred to, they are typified by certain
black-robed and stiff-necked gentlemen, whom
you may frequently meet. The liberation for
which the emperor waits also seems to me not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
that from any foreign yoke, but the redemption
from selfishness with its consequent evils.
Poor emperor! You may have to wait still
another thousand years in the world of the
gnomes before you will be able to resume
control over your kingdom. Sleep in peace!
The time will not seem to you long; for it is
not you who suffers, and there is no measurement
of time during sleep or in eternity.</p>

<p>Owing to the increase of modern culture,
and its accompanying sophistry and scepticism,
visible intercourse with the gnomes has become
of comparatively rare occurrence, especially
because their kindness has often been
abused and their services misapplied, as the
following story will show, which I may be
permitted to insert, as it is not without
bearing upon the events told in the succeeding
chapters.</p>

<p>A short distance from the city of Salzburg,
and upon a hill covered by a forest of pines,
there stood in ancient times the castle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Tollenstein, of which now only some remnants
are left. The walls are in ruins, but these go
to show that formerly they were parts of a
palatial building. One remnant composed of
huge square stones still indicates the extent
of the large banqueting-hall, where festivals
took place; and it is said that on certain nights
the orgies which these stones witnessed are
spectrally repeated and enacted in the astral
light by the ghost-like shapes of deceased ladies
and knights; while not far off there is a
dilapidated tower of massive structure, enclosing
a deep hole in the ground, where the
subterranean dungeon was located—the
“<i>oubliette</i>” or living tomb, in which poor
wretches for some offence were buried alive
and “forgotten,” left to starve or suffocate.
It is said that, during the nights when the
ghosts in the banqueting-hall hold gruesome
carousals, cries and groans and wails may be
heard coming from the bottom of that well.
These things I do not find difficult to believe;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
for we often find similar instances of the
proximity of luxury and misery among the
living in this our material world.</p>

<p>In ancient times the owner of the castle was
Burkhart von Tollenstein, a youthful and
valorous knight, admired by all the ladies in
the country on account of the voluminous
mass of golden hair which adorned his head.
This, together with his manliness and beauty,
gained for him the hearts of all those fair
ladies, except one, and this was the very one
for whose possession he craved, namely, the
very beautiful but proud Julia von Horst.</p>

<p>He had seen her only once, but that was
enough to make him fall desperately in love
with her face and figure. He had been happy
enough until he was so unfortunate as to have
the tranquillity of his heart destroyed by the
sight of her dark and languishing eyes. From
that time forward an image of the beautiful
Julia was formed in his mind, whose contemplation
absorbed him so that he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
of nothing else; henceforth nothing but the
thought of Julia had any attraction for him.
He sought to woo and to win the ideal of his
thoughts; but alas! his sighs and tears were all
in vain, for his home was poor, and the proud
Julia cared far more for money than for love!
She knew that Burkhart’s fortune was too small
to supply her with all the luxuries she desired;
therefore, when he offered her his heart, she
rejected it, and sneeringly said:</p>

<p>“Of what use will be your heart to me, if
starvation waits for me in your home?”</p>

<p>This offensive remark was more than a
knight of these times was able to bear in
patience, and Burkhart, cursing his poverty,
went home in despair. From day to day he
became more and more morose and melancholy,
grieving on account of the insufficiency of his
means. At last he determined to enrich himself
by whatever means he might find, and
resolved to rob the gnomes of the Untersberg
of their treasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>In these times it was customary for almost
everybody to have a wise and faithful steward
ready to give good advice. Burkhart’s
steward did his best to dissuade the knight
from this wicked and dangerous undertaking;
but in vain did old Bruno, for this was his
name, entreat him to desist from evil thoughts,
and to forget the proud Julia, as she was
entirely unworthy of his affection. The
knight would not listen.</p>

<p>“The Lord be merciful to you!” exclaimed
Bruno. “Shake off this delusion, O noble
knight; think of your high descent and what
your ancestors would say. Look upwards, to
where your salvation rests; the spirits of the
lower world will mislead and ruin you.”</p>

<p>But the knight answered, “I am not a
coward. I am not afraid of losing my life,
which is worthless to me without the possession
of Julia. More than once I have looked
into the face of death while engaged in battle.
I want the gold of the gnomes, and must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
it, let the consequences be what they may.
If the gnomes are not willing to surrender
their gold, I shall take it by force.”</p>

<p>Thus spurning good advice, the knight gave
orders that his black war-horse be brought
forth. This he bestrode, and trotted towards
the Untersberg.</p>

<p>It was a gloomy evening in November; the
leaves of the trees had turned yellow and red,
and rustled in the wind, and their voices
seemed to warn him not to proceed, while the
waving boughs motioned to him to return.
Soon the queen of the night began to spread
her mantle over the face of the earth, and there
arose in the gloom, like a gigantic shadow, the
outlines of the mysterious Untersberg. For a
moment fear overcame the youth, and he
stopped; but his desire overcame his fear, and
pronouncing an oath he spurred his horse,
determined to push on. Just then the horse
shied, and, looking up, Burkhart saw sitting by
the roadside a dwarf clothed in a steel-blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
gown. The dwarf looked steadily with glittering
eyes at the knight.</p>

<p>“Avaunt!” exclaimed Burkhart angrily.
“What are you sitting here and frightening
my horse for?”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho!” laughed the dwarf. “Know,
you creeping worm of the earth, I am Pypo,
the king of the gnomes. Mine is the Untersberg
with its treasures. What have you to
seek in my territory?”</p>

<p>When Burkhart heard these words he
deemed it prudent to speak politely to the
king of the gnomes. He therefore explained
to him his situation, and asked for the loan of
a sum of money, for which he promised his
everlasting gratitude.</p>

<p>The king groaned. “Confound your
gratitude,” he said; “there would be plenty
of wretches like you coming to borrow money
from me, if it could be had at such a cheap
price.”</p>

<p>“What then do you demand?” asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
knight. “State your terms, and I will accept
them, for I must have gold at any price!”</p>

<p>“Listen then,” said the gnome; “it is not
much that I ask. Only one hair from your head
for each thousand of florins.” Thus saying, his
eyes rested searchingly upon the face of the
knight.</p>

<p>“Only one hair from my head?” exclaimed
Burkhart in great astonishment. “A whole
lot of hair you shall have, and be welcome, if
you only furnish me the money necessary for
obtaining the favour of Julia.”</p>

<p>“I am putting no limits to the amount you
may draw,” laughed the king. “For each
thousand of florins which you receive from me
you will have to leave me one hair from your
head.”</p>

<p>“It is a bargain!” exclaimed the knight
joyfully, and, drawing his dagger, he was about
to proceed to cut a lock of hair from his forehead
to offer it to the king.</p>

<p>“Not so,” said Pypo. “Only one hair at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
time, and I will have to pull it out myself by
the root.”</p>

<p>So the knight dismounted, and as he bent
down the dwarf tore a single hair from his
scalp, after which he threw a bag of gold
at Burkhart’s feet.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” exclaimed the knight, as he
hugged the bag and gloated over its contents.</p>

<p>“No thanks are wanted,” replied the gnome;
“see to it that the hairs upon your head will
not become too few in time to purchase enough
gold for satisfying the greed of your Julia.”</p>

<p>So saying the gnome vanished; but the
knight returned with his bag of gold to the castle.
He now at once began to enlarge and improve
his house in exquisite style; he bought costly
furniture and ornaments, hired servants and
cooks, sent out invitations for dinners and balls,
and every evening he went to the Untersberg
for another bag of gold, leaving in return one
of his hairs.</p>

<p>Soon the news of the riches of Burkhart von<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Tollenstein began to spread, and everybody
wondered and came to see and admire the
luxury displayed by the knight. Now the
consent of Julia was easily gained, and before
many days the walls of the castle resounded
with gay music, merry-making, and laughter;
for the marriage of the valorous knight with
the beautiful countess took place. All the
nobility in the country were invited, and took
part in the revel.</p>

<p>Henceforth the castle of Tollenstein became
the scene of an uninterrupted succession of
festivities of all kinds; there was a merry-go-round,
and the doors of the house were open
day and night to visitors. Parasites of all
kinds peopled the castle. Dinners, dances,
masquerades, tournaments, theatrical performances
and hunting excursions followed each
other without end, and the beautiful Julia had
the sweet satisfaction of being surrounded by
flatterers and admirers to her heart’s content;
but her desires grew in proportion as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
were gratified, her vanity in proportion as it
was tickled: her whims were incalculable, but
the resources of her husband seemed to be
inexhaustible, and he was an object of envy to
everyone.</p>

<p>More and more frequent grew his visits to the
Untersberg, from each of which he returned
with a thousand florins in gold, but with one
less hair from his head; and for all that, he
seemed not to be happy, for he saw only too
clearly that he had bought only the appearance
of love, and that his wife loved not him
but only his money; and whenever he did not
at once comply with her unreasonable and
extravagant demands, she would treat him
with contempt, so as to render life a burden to
him. All this caused him a great deal of
grief, which he sought to drown in the wine-cup.
Thus he became at last a confirmed drunkard
and an object of disgust. All the evil germs in
his nature began to grow luxuriantly and to bear
fruit. He became a weakling, a cruel tyrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
towards his subjects, an abject coward in the
presence of his wife, who treated him as if he
were a slave. His troubles caused him to grow
prematurely old, and the hair upon his head
grew thinner from day to day.</p>

<p>Thus a few years passed away in great
misery, and at last poor Burkhart was entirely
bald-headed. The last florin was gone; but
the countess had ordered a great tournament
and dinner, to which many noblemen and
ladies of rank were invited. Once more
Burkhart went to the Untersberg for the
purpose of asking the king of the gnomes for
money; but no more hair did he have to give
in return. The gnome appeared, and the
knight, removing his helmet, showed him the
deplorable condition of his scalp, hoping to
arouse the pity of the king.</p>

<p>“Ah, Burkhart!” exclaimed Pypo; “did
I not tell you to beware that your hairs may
not become too few?”</p>

<p>“I now see my folly,” sighed the knight;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
“but for pity’s sake let me have only one more
bag of gold, to save myself from disgrace.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed the gnome. “Nothing
brings nothing. No hair, no money; our
bargain is at a end!”</p>

<p>“Ask what you will!” cried the knight;
“but hair I have no more to give. Take my
soul; but give me only one bag of money.
Only one bag of gold I am asking of you!”</p>

<p>But in vain Burkhart implored the gnome.
Pypo was inexorable, and laughed at him.
This exasperated Burkhart, and becoming
enraged, he cried: “Hell-hound! you have
completed your devilish work. With each
hair that you took from my head you robbed
me of a part of my manhood. Now I recognise
you as the fiend that you are. Give me back
my lost energy. Give me back the beautiful
golden hair of which you have despoiled me
by means of your accursed gold. Give it back
to me, or look out for the revenge of the
Tollensteins!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>But the gnome laughed. “Fool!” he said;
“do you wish to frighten me? Would you
now curse the one from whom you received all
that you wanted? I laugh at you and your
threats; but if you wish your hair returned,
be it so!”</p>

<p>So saying the gnome drew forth a cord
twisted from Burkhart’s hair, and threw it at
the feet of the knight. He then disappeared
within the depths of the Untersberg, while
from all sides a mocking laughter shook the
air, as if coming from a multitude of invisible
spectators; but the knight went home and
locked himself up in his bedroom.</p>

<p>At the castle of Tollenstein everything was
in readiness for the beginning of the great
tournament. Knights in glittering armour
and ladies in costly dresses were thronging
the halls; while in the courtyard below richly
decked steeds, attended by grooms in bright
colours, neighed and stamped the ground,
impatient for the opening of the sham fight;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
for the beginning of which nothing was now
needed but the presence of the host. The
trumpets sounded, but nothing was seen of
Burkhart. Repeatedly were messengers sent
to his room, but they found the door locked
and were not admitted. At last Julia, losing
her patience, went up with clenched fists to inquire
about the cause of this delay, but her
knocks at the door elicited no reply. She
therefore ordered the door to be forced open,
and then a ghastly sight met her eyes. Burkhart
von Tollenstein was lying dead on his
bed, his features distorted as if he had died in
great agony; around his neck was tied a cord
of yellow human hair, with which he had
been strangled; his eyes were protruding as if
starting from their sockets; while his fingers
were spasmodically closed around a bag containing
one thousand florins in gold. This was
the end of the Tollensteins.</p>

<p>And now the excuses for writing the following
tale:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>If this story of Burkhart of Tollenstein had
never been exhumed from the archives containing
the family histories of the ancient
knights of the Duchy of Salzburg, the
following chapters would never have been
written; for it was the discovery of these
reliable documents which recalled to my
memory the history told to me by my now
deceased friend, Mr Schneider, who was
himself a participant in the adventure which I
am about to describe.</p>

<p>It appears that, long after the death of
Burkhart von Tollenstein, three very learned
gentlemen, having heard of that story, arrived
from some far-off country—presumably from
the dark continent. Being of a very sceptical
turn of mind, they did not believe in gnomes,
and had undertaken their journey for the
purpose of disproving the existence of the
spirits of Nature. They belonged to a scientific
Society, whose object was the abolition
of the supernatural, and to sober up mankind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
by drawing away their attention from all sorts
of ideals, and bring them back to the dry and
hard facts of material life. That Society had
already accomplished a great deal of important
work. They had by a certain system
of logic disproved the existence of God, spirit
and soul, and shown that all that is called life
or consciousness is nothing else but the result
of friction brought on by the mechanical
motion of molecules of dead matter accidentally
coming into contact with each other.
The three gentlemen with whom we shall
directly become acquainted were appointed
by the Society for the Abolition of the Supernatural
as a committee, for the purpose of
giving the last death-blow to the superstitious
belief in spirits and gnomes, and arrived for
that purpose. They were firmly determined
that the belief in anything that could not be
seen by means of corporeal eyes, or grasped
with fingers of flesh, should be relegated into
the garret, where antiquated superstitions are
stowed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>After due consultation, these gentlemen
resolved to make a scientific expedition to
one of the caves of the Untersberg, reported
to be haunted; and Mr Schneider, being
then a young and vigorous man, well acquainted
with the topography of the mountain,
was invited to accompany them. The
excursion took place on the day preceding
St John’s, it being the 23rd of June; but the
date of the year escaped my memory. The
adventures which Mr Schneider experienced
are told by him in the following pages.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT a thousand feet
below the summit of
the Untersberg, and
not very far from the
top of one of its spurs, that reaches out into the
valley through which runs the limpid stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
coming from the renowned lake called the
“Koenigsee,” there is a spacious cave, within
an almost perpendicular slope of rocks, several
hundred feet in height. This cave or hole,
called the “Dragon’s Den,” is large enough for
affording shelter to a whole herd of cattle, and
high enough so that a good-sized church,
steeple and all, might be put therein. Its
roof is formed by an overhanging rock (as is
shown in our picture), and the hole extends
like a tunnel from one side of the hill to the
other; so that if seen from below it appears
like an archway through which the sky and
the stars on the other side may be seen.</p>

</figure>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<p>This den is said to have been inhabited in
ancient times by a villainous dragon of a very
peculiar kind, having no conscience, reason, or
common sense, but being exceedingly selfish.
His greatest pleasure was to dissect and analyse
everything, and to destroy all that was of an
ideal nature; to tear the clothes away from
everything exalted and beautiful for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
of exposing bare facts. These he liked so
well, that he imagined the bones of every
creature were its only essential parts; so he
tore the flesh of his victims away and devoured
their bones. From the altitude of his
den he would overlook both sides of the hill, and
whenever he saw a pretty maiden wandering
among the rocks in search of the Alpine rose
or the Edelweiss, he would pounce upon her,
drag her to his den, dissect her, and strip her
of all flesh, and devour the bones piece by
piece. It is said that later on the dragon
emigrated into the valley, but his den was
selected by the committee for the investigation
concerning the non-existence of gnomes.</p>

<p>Before we proceed further, it will be necessary
to introduce the reader to our friends.
There was, first of all, Professor Thomas
Cracker, a member of nearly all scientific
societies in the world, a great sceptic, who, by
a long course of scientifically training his
imagination, had acquired such a degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
scientific scepticism that he always knew
everything without taking the trouble of
looking at it. There was no fact in Nature
for which he had not invented a theory; and if
the theory did not fit it, so much the worse
for the facts. He had become celebrated;
because, owing to his superior sagacity, and
after years of persevering study, he had succeeded
in discovering that a certain book
entitled “Little Alice in Wonderland,” was
only a fable, not based upon historical
facts, and whose object was to bamboozle the
ignorant and take in unwary and gullible
people. Owing to the great merit obtained
by this work the honour and title of a member
of the Academy was bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>Mr Cracker’s father had been the keeper of
a variety shop, and was in the habit of ignoring
and treating with contempt everything
that was not of his own manufacture or kept
in his shop. Nevertheless, among the good
articles which he kept for sale, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
many things that had gone out of fashion.
These he used to fit up in a new style, varnish
and paint them over, give them new labels
with modern names, and advertise them as
something brand new. Thus he did a good
trade and gained a reputation.</p>

<p>Professor Cracker, junior, resembled his
father to a dot, only he traded in less tangible
goods. He also was in the habit of ignoring
and treating with contempt everything that
did not agree with the theories that were
manufactured by himself or his colleagues;
nevertheless there were among his articles of
creed certain doctrines taught centuries ago, but
having gone out of fashion. These he used to
take down from the garret where they had been
forgotten, dress them up in modern style, varnish
them over with modern expressions, label
them with newly invented names, and advertise
them as brand-new discoveries, or goods of his
own invention. In this way Professor Cracker
traded in science and gained a reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>The next was the Reverend Jeremiah
Stiffbone, a clergyman, who had received from
his congregation a liberal amount of money
to enable him to travel in search of the truth
that could not be found at home. Mr Stiffbone
was well versed in all sorts of authorities,
and able to quote almost any number
of books in support of almost any opinion,
for he knew the contents of many scientific
and religious writings,—that is to say, he knew
what was written therein; but as to his knowledge
in regard to the subjects themselves, it
would be difficult to decide what it was; for
he one day believed in this and the next day
in another author’s veracity, and the one into
whom he put his faith was for the time being
to him the only infallible one. Thus he
stumbled along upon the path of wisdom,
falling from one opinion into another like a
person in a state of intoxication. It should
not be supposed, however, that Jeremiah
loved this state of uncertainty and wavering.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
What he wanted, above all, was to establish a
scientific and religious system that could be
fully depended on as being true and reliable,
and containing articles and scientific doctrines
which everyone would have to accept
as true, and go to sleep quietly, being firmly
convinced that the opinions therein were
the final dictates of science, incontrovertible,
not subject to improvement, and fully correct.</p>

<p>As to the external appearance of the above-named
two gentlemen, Professor Cracker was
of short stature, thickly set, with a rubicund
face, smoothly shaven, except a pair of grey
side-whiskers. His little eyes continually
wandered restlessly from one object to
another, his arms were unusually long, but
his legs short and bow-shaped, and all this
somehow contributed to give him the appearance
of a Mandril (<i>Cynocephalus Maimon</i>),
as may be said without giving offence to the
Professor; for he was himself firmly of the
opinion that the whole of man had descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
from the ape. He even looked with satisfaction
upon his long line of ancestors, and
prided himself on having become somehow
superior to them in the art of reasoning, if
not in bodily strength.</p>

<p>As to the Reverend Stiffbone, he seemed
the reverse of Professor Cracker. He was
thin and tall, looking like a collection of bones
of some antediluvian bird. His features were
sharp, his head almost bald, and his mouth
wide, while his chin and nose were long and
protruding, as if they were trying to meet
each other. Upon his nose he wore a pair of
green goggles of great size, causing him to
appear not unlike an owl; but his nose and
chin gave him a resemblance to one of the
well-known wooden nut-crackers, which are
manufactured in the city of Nuremberg, and
are the delight of the children all over the
world.</p>

<p>Finally, there was Moses Abraham Scalawag,
Esq., the commercial business manager of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
expedition. His external appearance went to
show that he was not much of an idealist, but
preferred the good and material things of this
life, and had no aversion to a certain kind in
spirits. Although he denounced the belief in
hobgoblins, ghosts, gnomes, etc., as a degraded
superstition, he somehow thought that, if the
story of Burkhart von Tollenstein were true,
it might be worth the while to investigate the
financial condition of the gnomes in the
Untersberg.</p>

<p>We were accompanied by a guide, carrying
our provisions and scientific instruments.
This guide was a direct descendant of the
reputed Lazarus Gitschner, who in the year
1529 spent ten days among the gnomes in
the Untersberg. We attempted to draw him
out, but the guide would not reveal what his
ancestor had seen during that visit; nor is
this surprising, for Lazarus himself never
revealed it to anybody except to the priest in
the confessional. All that has become known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
about it is, that he came out of the Untersberg
a man entirely changed from what he was
before he went in, and the priest also, after
hearing the confession, became very much
changed himself, even so that he left off playing
ninepins on Sunday morning, led a
retired life, and died not long afterwards in
the odour of sanctity.</p>

<p>Bright was the day, and the earth looked
refreshed from the morning dew that still
rested upon the daffodils and ferns, where it
glittered in the light of the sun like so many
small diamonds. The air was fragrant from
the odour of pines and wild thyme, and the
breeze carried up from the valley an aroma of
new-mown hay. Peacefully grazed the goats
upon the sides of a hill, from which rushed a
small cataract in a thousand cascades, while
an air of tranquillity and solemnity rested upon
the scene below, interrupted only by the
tolling of the bell in the distant village church,
which sounded harmoniously into the solitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Of all this, however, our members of the
committee saw, heard, smelt, and knew
nothing; for each was absorbed in his own
thoughts. Professor Cracker moved slowly on,
carrying his wig on his walking-stick over his
shoulder, and revelling in the anticipation of
the glory which the annihilation of the gnome
theory would bring upon him. The Rev.
Stiffbone’s long coat-tails fluttered in the wind
as he marched on, taking long strides upon
the uneven path, and his thoughts were
absorbed in the prospect of being able to add
another incontrovertible doctrine in regard to
the non-existing of gnomes to his <i>Bible of
Science</i>. Mr Scalawag wobbled along as well
as he could, thinking nothing particular, but
stopping frequently and wiping the sweat
from his brow. At last he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Confound these gnomes! Is it worth the
while to climb up to that den and waste our
valuable time in disproving that such animals
exist?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>To this the Reverend Stiffbone replied:</p>

<p>“Gnomes are not animals, but imaginary
beings. Theophrastus Paracelsus describes
them as being intellectual forces in nature,
whatever that may mean. They are about
six inches in height, but able to change and
to elongate their bodies.”</p>

<p>“But how can you determine their height,”
asked Mr Scalawag, “if they are merely
imaginary? You may just as well imagine
them to be a thousand feet, if you try.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” interrupted Professor Cracker; for
that was his favourite impression whenever
anything was mentioned that was unknown to
him. “Rot! there are no such things as
intelligent forces of nature, neither imaginary
ones nor others. This degrading superstition
has now lasted long enough, and this day will
make an end to such vagaries.”</p>

<p>“Are you then firmly convinced,” asked Mr
Scalawag, rather dejectedly, “that the treasures
of the gnomes in the Untersberg do not exist?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“They exist only in the imagination of
fools,” replied the Professor. “There can be no
such thing as a spirit, as I shall demonstrate
to you to-day by means of my new spiritoscope.”</p>

<p>“It is strange,” now remarked the Rev.
Stiffbone, “that there are still some respectable
authorities favouring such a superstitious
belief. Even the Bible mentions the existence
of spirits in more than one instance.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” replied the Professor. “There is
no theory so absurd that it may not find
admirers among otherwise intelligent people.
Only think of the many fools who imagine it
to be possible to make cars that are pulled by
steam!”</p>

<p>“Do you then believe it to be absolutely
impossible to make railways?” asked Mr
Scalawag.</p>

<p>“Railways!” sneeringly exclaimed Cracker.
“Rot! No man in his sane senses would ever
think of such a thing. Steam can blow; but
it cannot pull cars; if a steam-engine were invented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
it would scald everybody to death.
As to those eccentric and fanatical people who
now fancy it possible to make a railway between
Manchester and Liverpool, I have only
to say that we, the scientists of this century,
decline to waste our time in examining such
wild and extravagant schemes. Even if the
tales told in some of the newspapers were true,
instead of being deplorable vagaries, and if it
were possible to invent such an engine, it
would not interest us, for surely nobody would
be insane enough to trust his life and his
safety to an engine going at the terrible speed
of sixteen miles an hour! No, my dear sir!
To make a railway is as impossible as that
stones should fall from heaven; the reason of
which impossibility the Academy of Science
has pointed out, namely, because there are no
stones in the sky.”</p>

<p>It may be observed that this conversation
took place before the time when meteors were
known and railways in action; at the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
time such a display of scientific ignorance
would of course be impossible.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said the Rev. Stiffbone, “we
admit for argument’s sake that a railway could
be made on a level plain. What would they
do if they were to come to a mountain? They
would have to dig a hole through it, pass
through it in the dark, and coming out at the
other end the passengers would suddenly
emerge into the light. This sudden change
would undoubtedly strike them blind.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly it would,” added Professor
Cracker, “unless they were to wear travelling-goggles
for protection. You may however rest
assured that, if railways could be made, we
would have discovered it long ago, and the
same may be said in regard to gnomes, ghosts,
spirits, or intelligent forces of any kind. If
there were such things we would know it.”</p>

<p>“How is it then possible,” I asked, “that
the ancient philosophers believed such things?”</p>

<p>“To a layman like you,” answered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Professor, “such a question may be pardoned.
The ancient philosophers were fools; they did
not know as much as one of our schoolboys
knows to-day. As to Lord Lytton, Goethe,
and other more modern writers who spoke of
such things, they only did so because they
loved to make jokes for the amusement of the
wise, and to have some fun at the expense of
the gullible. We know that spirit without
matter does not exist. Matter is visible;
consequently the spirits would have to possess
visible forms. We also know that no kind of
living beings can exist within solid rocks, where
they would be without water and air, and
finally, if there were any intelligent forces in
nature, they would know the importance of
coming forward and proving their existence
to men of science.”</p>

<p>I remarked that a belief in gnomes was
quite common in this country, and asked
whether this could be explained.</p>

<p>“Ridiculously easy!” said the Professor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
“The sources of error are—inherited
idiosyncrasies; a want of scientific training
in making observations; subjective, objective,
and epidemic hallucinations; credulity,
hysteria, suggestion, dreams, hypnotism, post-hypnotic
auto-suggestion, and so forth.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” I objected, “there are
those who have been touched by gnomes, have
seen and conversed with them, received
tangible objects from them.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” replied Cracker. “It is all due to
wilful deception, humbug, swindle, trumpery,
fraud, plagiarism, coincidence, telepathic
impact, thought-transfer, unconscious cerebration,
mediumship, sympathetic association of
ideas, etc. Only recently I have discovered,
after making a long research and consulting
many authorities, that the accounts given in
<i>Gulliver’s Travels</i> were not based upon
historical facts, but are only the products of
the imagination of the author, who for thus
imposing upon the credulity of the public,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
must be regarded as being one of the greatest
cheats of his age. Fetch me a spirit or
gnome, and let me dissect it to see of what it
is made. Unless you do so, I say that it is
nothing but rot, the product of the disordered
fancy of a scientifically untrained brain.”</p>

<p>I did not quite agree with Cracker’s views,
and I therefore said: “I believe that there
are still people capable of telling a pigtail
from a broomstick without dissecting it and
having it certified to by a professor of science.”</p>

<p>Cracker and Stiffbone exchanged an ominous
look.</p>

<p>“This,” said Stiffbone, “comes from the
increased disrespect for the authorities. Nowadays
everybody imagines that he has a right
to think and say what he pleases. It is time
that a law ought to be made punishing heresy
in science, as it used to be punished in regard
to religion. Not long ago I heard a new
heresy preached about what they call ‘conservation
of energy.’ Men ought not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
permitted to go about and poison the minds
of the public by spreading erroneous scientific
doctrines. We absolutely need a <i>Bible of
Science</i>, stating exactly what scientific beliefs
the people are to accept.”</p>

<p>“Such a book,” answered the Professor,
“would be of the greatest benefit to the
world, and prevent the injurious and misleading
self-thinking done by laymen and
ignorant tramps. What business have the
common people to do their own thinking?
No one ever attempts to make his own shoes
or clothes, but leaves this to his shoemaker or
tailor, who can do it much better, cheaper
and quicker than he could do it himself.
Why not apply the same system to deciding
scientific or religious questions? Let the
thinking in regard to such things be left to
those who are trained and entitled to it.”</p>

<p>With these views the Rev. Stiffbone fully
agreed. “Science,” he said, “ought to be
left to the scientists, religion to the clergy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
morality to the police, medicine to the
physicians, money matters to bankers, and
ideal things to legally appointed idealists.
This would enable the people to give more
attention to their own material interests.
Instead of thinking about things which bring
them no profit, they might employ their time
for useful things, such as the raising of hogs.
Religion ought not to be neglected, for the
fear of the devil is the security of the Church;
but one authentic sermon printed and posted
every Sunday in public places would save the
employment of an army of preachers, and
moreover secure conformity to the doctrines
taught everywhere. If the people must have
music, one or two organ-grinders would be
enough for a town of no more than a thousand
inhabitants; if they wanted poetry, one well-trained
and diplomatised verse-maker could
supply the whole country.”</p>

<p>“These questions,” said M. Scalawag, Esq.,
“deserve the most careful consideration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Time is money. The struggle for existence is
the first law among all beings; the survival of
the fittest its necessary result. Let everyone
take as much care as he can of his own interest,
and leave it to those who are appointed
for that purpose to look out for the rest.”</p>

<p>“We are appointed for that,” exclaimed
Professor Cracker, “and we will attend to it.
I have just discovered a new system of
hypnotism by means of which large crowds
can be hypnotised at once. Instead of sending
the children to school, we will hypnotise
into their heads all that we want them to
know, and cause them to post-hypnotically
forget all which we do not wish them to
remember. Thus we will be the kings of the
world, and all mankind will dance as we pull
the strings!”</p>

<p>While carrying on these discussions we
arrived at the “Dragon’s Den,” where our
investigations were to begin. The place
showed no indication of the presence of spirit;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
there was nothing dismal about it; on the
contrary, an air of peace seemed to rest upon
the scene. At the entrance of the cave there
was a wild rosebush of considerable size and
some Alpine flowers, among which I noticed
the Larkspur and Belladonna. The walls
consisted of marble rocks, exhibiting a variety
of colours, and were covered in some places
with mosses and ferns. In a shady corner
there was still a remnant of snow, resembling
a miniature glacier, and rendering the air cool
and pleasant. The two openings at the sides
offered a magnificent view.</p>

<p>The guide—who had remained a little behind,
as his movements were greatly impeded by the
legs of Professor Cracker’s spiritoscope, which
he carried—now arrived with his bag of provisions,
and unpacked his treasures. Cold
meats, poultry and cheese, ham and eggs,
butter and bread, made their appearance, and
were soon disposed of by the committee.
Beer and wine had not been forgotten, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Professor Cracker, filling his glass with
champagne, lifted it up and offered a toast,
“to the annihilation of the gnomes;” which
was followed by another toast, pronounced by
Jeremiah Stiffbone, “to Professor Cracker, the
king of science, and inventor of the spiritoscope,”
while Mr Scalawag, in offering his
sentiments, said he hoped to find some of the
treasures of the Untersberg.</p>

<p>After the refreshments were taken, the
investigations began. To begin with, the
committee carefully examined the rocks and
walls and every nook and corner of the
“Dragon’s Den” for the purpose of convincing
themselves that there was no place where
anybody might hide himself and play a
practical joke upon the investigators. They
measured the size of the rocks, and made sure
of their solidity and the entire absence of any
subterranean caves or holes. The floor was
found to be perfectly solid, and no gnomes
were to be seen. Thereupon they carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
noted the hour and the minute, as is always
necessary on such occasions, and evidence was
taken that the sky was clear. The direction
of the wind was determined with great accuracy,
and found to be E.N.E.; the temperature was
taken and the various thermometers indicated—25°
Celsius, 20° Reaumur, and 77° Fahrenheit;
the barometer showed an elevation of 5800
feet above the sea and a medium atmospheric
pressure. No gnome or spirit of any kind
appeared upon the scene, nor was there to be
found anything whatever of a spiritual character.
After all the necessary preparations
were made Professor Cracker produced his spiritoscope,
whose description we are permitted to
give for the benefit of all psychical researchers;
and as a boon to the whole of mankind:</p>


<p class="center"><i>Dr Cracker’s Spiritoscope.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>This ingeniously constructed and very
simple, although somewhat ponderous
instrument was the original invention of
Professor Cracker, and enabled him, instead of
directly looking at an object, to behold and
examine it by means of a series of reflections
produced by four scientifically arranged
mirrors bent towards each other at angles of
45 degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_052">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_052.jpg" alt="THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The main body of the instrument consisted
of a wooden box in which the four above-named
mirrors were placed so as to face
each other, and to the box was attached a
telescope-tube. Thus a ray of light coming
from an outside object and entering the
box would produce an image in the first
mirror; this would become reflected in the
second and third, and finally in the fourth,
where it could be seen through the telescope.</p>

<p>The whole apparatus was mounted upon a
tripod with movable legs, so that it could be
turned in every direction.</p>

<p>It will naturally be asked, how could Professor
Cracker expect by such natural means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
to discover anything supernatural, and what
is the benefit of looking at the reflection of a
thing in a mirror, if it might be just as well
seen directly with the eye? As to the first
question, Professor Cracker did not admit
the existence of anything beyond the common
aspect of nature, and needed therefore no
instrument for its discovery; while in regard
to the second question, he said that direct
vision was unscientific and unreliable, because
what a man sees, or believes to see, may be
caused by irregular cerebral action, hallucination,
defective sight, ecstasy, trance, clairvoyance,
or other diseases; but mirrors could
not be deceived—they would not become hallucinated,
or enter into a state of ecstasy:—they
only showed what was actually true, and
there was no humbug about them. Direct
sight was well enough for common people
with common sense, but indirect vision for
science.</p>

<p>Heretofore the great merit of this spiritoscope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
was, as Professor Cracker repeatedly
pointed out, that it had never produced any
other than negative results, but these had
been obtained unfailingly on all occasions,
for it had actually never indicated the presence
of any genius, gnome, ghost, or spirit whatever;
but as the instrument was constructed
according to unquestionable principles, these
negative results were fully sufficient to prove
the correctness of Professor Cracker’s theory.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, there seemed to
be something the matter with the spiritoscope.
Be it that the mirrors were not in order, or
that even scientific and indirect vision may be
deceptive, there was evidently some kind of
an obscuration within the tube, which could
not be explained by natural causes. In vain
Professor Cracker repeatedly cleaned his spectacles,
and ultimately substituted coloured
glasses for them; the fact was undeniable
that something dark, some sort of a shadow,
appeared repeatedly within the field of indirect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
vision, and this something must have been
alive, for it moved about by means of some
energy contained within itself, and without
being kinetically impelled by any discoverable
extraneous force. Repeatedly the Professor
exclaimed the ominous word: “rot!”
and “bosh!” and “impossible!” His scepticism
had to give way before the evidence
produced by his spiritoscope, and at last he
was overcome by the conviction of having
discovered a gnome. He looked somewhat
pale, as with bated breath and with ill-suppressed
excitement he announced the discovery
to his colleagues.</p>

<p>It was now Rev. Stiffbone’s turn to take a
look through the spiritoscope. He, too, saw
the shadow, and saw it move. Owing to the
circumstance that the light fell into the instrument
from the side opposed to the standpoint
of the observer, the part of the spirit
turned toward Stiffbone’s eye could not be
clearly seen, but its outlines seemed to grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
sometimes larger and sometimes smaller, from
which he inferred that the spirit was a gnome,
as they were said to be able to change the size
of their forms.</p>

<p>These observations were corroborated by
Mr Scalawag. Professor Cracker looked again,
and having satisfied himself that there could
be no possible mistake, he made a speech, in
which he said that it had been reserved for
him to make the greatest discovery of this
age, and that the existence of gnomes—which
had heretofore been doubted by certain too
sceptical people—was now an established fact,
demonstrated by him for the first time in
human history.</p>

<p>But alas! “this world is but a fleeting
show,” and even the demonstrations of science
cannot always be depended upon as absolutely
true, for while the Professor made his speech,
the head of a little mouse appeared at the
opening of the tube, and seeing the coast
clear, the mouse jumped to the ground and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
ran away. How the mouse happened to
come into the spiritoscope has never been
satisfactorily explained. The committee
looked perplexed, and Cracker grew red in
the face.</p>

<p>“<i>Errare humanum est!</i>” exclaimed
Stiffbone, and Mr Scalawag added: “We
are all liars. The best plan will be to say
nothing about it.”</p>

<p>Although the committee did not believe
thenceforth in spirits, it can nevertheless not
be denied that a spirit of gloom rested upon
them after this incident; a scowl rested upon
the Professor’s face, and he admitted that for
once in his life he had been mistaken.</p>

<p>While they discussed this matter the wind
had changed from E.N.E. to N., and now a
light puff of air brought a piece of paper
flying into the cave. Rev. Stiffbone saw it,
and picked it up. There were written upon
it the following verses:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O foolish mortal, by dull senses bound;</div>
<div class="verse">Within thyself the spirit must be found.</div>
<div class="verse">Know thou thyself, and by self-knowledge know</div>
<div class="verse">The lives above and in the world below.</div>
<div class="verse">In every sphere each being knows its own;</div>
<div class="verse">To spirits only spirits can be shown.</div>
</div></div>

<p>After reading these lines, Mr Stiffbone
handed the paper to the Professor, and asked
him what he thought. The Professor carefully
examined the structure of the paper and
said:</p>

<p>“This is nothing but an ordinary piece
of notepaper, manufactured in this country.
There is nothing supernatural about it.”</p>

<p>“But the verses,” answered Stiffbone. “They
seem to refer to the subject of our conversation.
How is this coincidence to be explained?”</p>

<p>“In a very simple manner,” replied Professor
Cracker, growing more and more
excited as he spoke. “You, sir, have
written these miserable verses yourself, for
the purpose of playing it on me; but let me
assure you that, even if I have been imposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
on by a mouse, I am not going to be fooled
by such a ragamuffin as yourself; your trick
was not clever enough for that.”</p>

<p>During this speech the Rev. Stiffbone, with
open mouth, stared aghast at the Professor,
and the word “ragamuffin” aroused his temper.
He said that such an ill-founded accusation
was calculated to greatly lessen his respect
for one whose capacity to judge he had anyhow
always regarded as doubtful, and that
he owed it to his own respectability as a
clergyman to regard Mr Cracker’s calumnies
as being those of a man in his dotage, if not
a wilful perverter of truth.</p>

<p>Cracker retorted again, and it is doubtful
how the matter would have ended, but just
at that moment a long-drawn sigh was heard,
coming from some invisible source, and at the
next moment a gust of wind followed that
overthrew the spiritoscope, and sent Stiffbone’s
hat flying out at the other end of the
Dragon’s Den. Directly afterwards the cave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
became illumined by a flash of lightning, and
this was succeeded by a clap of thunder which
caused the ground to tremble, and reverberated
like the firing of a battery of guns through
the clefts in the neighbourhood. The committee
stood aghast and terrified, looking at
each other in a perplexed manner and not
knowing what to do.</p>

<p>It appears that the sky had become suddenly
overcast with clouds, and a storm gathered at
the top of the Untersberg, while our friends
were too much absorbed in their scientific
researches to notice it, and now the rain began
to come down in torrents, and the archway
offered but little protection, for sheets of rain
were blown in at the open side of the cave,
and streams of water began to flow in every
direction over the ground.</p>

<p>In a few moments the members of the committee
and myself were drenched to the skin,
and did not know what to begin; but our
guide, drawing aside the branches of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
rosebush that stood at the entrance, pointed
out to us an excavation in the rock, which
had escaped the observation of the committee,
and he invited us to enter. Into this hole we
crawled one after another; and after proceeding
a few feet it grew wider, and formed a
hollow of considerable size. Here we were
comfortable enough, only we were wet, and
the place was perfectly dark.</p>

<p>Professor Cracker struck a light, and lit a
candle which he happened to have in his
pocket, and by that aid we discovered a
passage leading still further into the interior
of the hill. This we decided to explore.
Professor Cracker entered with his candle,
then came Rev. Stiffbone, after him Mr Scalawag,
and finally myself, each man holding on
to the coat-tail of the one who preceded.</p>

<p>Thus we went on for a considerable distance,
when suddenly a draught of cold air blew out the
Professor’s light. At the same time Mr Cracker’s
foot hit against some soft elastic substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of an unknowable kind, and directly afterwards
he received a fearful blow upon his abdomen
from something unseen. Turning round for
escaping the invisible enemy, he received
another blow that sent him flying heels over
head, overturning the Rev. Stiffbone, who in
his turn upset Mr Scalawag. They were all
lying in a heap, and I heard Cracker’s voice
producing a series of most unearthly yells;
but the Rev. Stiffbone, while begging for
mercy and blindly grasping about, clutched
the air and got hold of Mr Scalawag’s hair,
who defended himself with his fists; but my
observations were also cut short, for I had just
time, as my eyes became accustomed to the
darkness, to see a still darker object rushing
at me over the prostrate forms of my friends,
when I myself received a severe blow upon my
stomach, that caused me to lose my senses,
and for a moment I knew nothing more.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap">IT seems that during the
consternation caused
by this event, I must
have unconsciously wandered
off, for when I gathered
my senses again, I found myself in a strange
labyrinth of rocks. In vain I tried to find
my way back to the Dragon’s Den; there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
perpendicular walls and precipices encompassing
me on all sides, and the only outlet which
I discovered led me still higher up towards
the main body of the Untersberg.</p>

<p>The storm-clouds had disappeared and the
sky was clear; but my mind (if there is such
a thing) was somewhat confused; I did not
know which was which. Owing to Professor
Cracker’s exposition about the unreliability of
direct vision, I could not tell whether the
things around me were actually there, or
whether they were merely the products of
auto-suggestion, trumpery, etc. More than
once I bumped my head against a projecting
rock, because my method of observation was
not scientifically trained enough to enable me
to realise the actuality of the rock without
a knock-down argument. I had always
fancied before that if one receives an impression
from an object, be it in the waking
state or in a dream, an object or image of
some kind must be actually present, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
which that impression comes; but now I
saw that, according to science, impressions
may come from nothing and may be only
the products of the accidental friction of
brain molecules. I was therefore no longer
sure of the existence of anything that had
not been analysed and attested to by a
scientific expert.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the sun was about to
set, and that I was still wandering on, querying
whether I actually was myself or whether
some gnome was playing a trick upon my
imagination, making me believe that I was I.
There was nothing to prove to me scientifically
that the something or nothing which imagined
itself to be myself was not something else,
entirely unknown to me, provided there was
such a thing as “myself” at all, which seemed
rather doubtful, it having not yet been
analysed and its composition shown. I can,
in truth, only say that something which somehow
seemed to be myself (but to whom it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
seemed so, I do not know) imagined itself to
be I; but, for all I know, there may be no
“I,” and it may have been nothing but space.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, or to something, that the
setting sun was gilding the ice-fields of the
neighbouring mountain-peaks with floods of
light, and I (or something) received or seemed
to receive the impression somehow, that tints
of various hues, beginning with a dainty rose-colour,
followed by orange, yellow, sea-green,
and ending with blue, were adorning the sky (if
there was any), while clouds, apparently floating
within the depths of space (whose existence
has not yet been proved scientifically), seemed
to appear like fleecy masses of pure silver,
lined with fluid gold. The vegetation (provided
that there actually was one) appeared to be
more scanty than below, and to consist mainly
of clusters of Rhododendron, and occasionally a
specimen of Mandrake, Gentian, or Thyme was
to be seen or imagined. Judging from certain
impressions, which something that seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
be myself appeared to receive, I seemed to
arrive at the conclusion that there were rocks
covered with green moss, upon which grew
various ferns and some Ericas. Tranquillity
somehow seemed to reign supreme in this
altitude, although this is a mere assertion,
which I am not prepared to prove; and I
seemed to perceive nothing which could
have led anyone to infer that the stillness was
in any way interrupted, except by the song of
a finch that was sitting or appeared to sit
upon the branch of a tree—always supposing
that the tree was actually there—and the
croaking of a flock of ravens, which were
flying or seemed to be flying around the tops
of the Untersberg. I say all this with a
certain reserve, and confess myself unable to
prove it; because direct vision is unreliable,
and I had no spiritoscope at my command.</p>

<p>I say that all this seemed (to whom?) to be
as described; but even this is not scientifically
exact or correct; for not knowing myself, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
could I have the cheek to assert that I
actually perceived anything, or nothing, or
everything? How could I make any exact
statement about myself if I am not acquainted
with myself, and do not know whether or not
I exist? I love to be scientifically exact in my
statements, and to avoid making wild assertions.
I wish (or imagine to wish) to express
myself in a manner leaving no room for the
learned critic to misunderstand or misinterpret
my words, and to speak so plainly that everybody
must necessarily understand what I
mean; but I find that this philosophical and
round-about way of describing things is very
inconvenient, and that for the reader’s own
sake I cannot persevere in it. Everything in
this world seems to be only relatively true,
and if we were bound to speak nothing but
absolute truth, and express it in a manner that
could not possibly be misunderstood by
anybody, we would surely be doomed to
eternal silence. I must therefore ask the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
permission of the reader to depart from this
exact and strictly scientific method of speaking
and circumscribing, and to do like people of
common sense, and tell what I experienced or
believed to experience, as if I were really
something whose existence had been proved
and recognised by science, even if I have no
other proof of my existence to offer, except
that I am. This being myself is a reality to
me, but it may be discredited by another; for
there can be nothing real to anybody except
what he or she realises, and if they realise it,
it is, or seems to be, real to them. During my
visit in the Untersberg I realised my existence,
or seemed to realise it just as much as at any
other time in my life (always provided that I
exist and live), and the experiences through
which I passed were just as real to me as any
other experiences before or after that event.
Let those who doubt my words, or deny the
possibility of what I describe as having
occurred, doubt or deny to their heart’s content;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
they cannot rob me of the satisfaction
of knowing what I know.</p>

<p>Somehow I felt myself more free than usual;
my body moved without experiencing any
fatigue, and I seemed to have no weight.
Owing, perhaps, to the invigorating influence
of the mountain air, I felt myself filled with
strength; my mind was tranquil, my heart full
of joy,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and, as it were, one with the spirit of
all nature—if I may be permitted to use such
an expression—and it may be for this reason
that I understood the language of nature as
plainly as if it had been expressed in audible
words, for the rushing of a distant waterfall
spoke to me of eternal motion; the presence of
the earth of the substantiality of the universe,
nourishing all things; the wide expanse of the
air of universal freedom; and the fiery orb of
the sinking sun of an universal consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
whose existence cannot be proved, but which
may be experienced by souls that are free.
Even the flowers had a language of their own,
speaking to me of purity, beauty, modesty,
and similar principles unknown to modern
science, and not yet analysed and classified.</p>

<p>As I scrambled on the scenery grew more
wild. Huge boulders of enormous size often
blocked the way, throwing fantastic shadows
upon the ground. Slowly the sun disappeared
behind the slopes of the western range, and
solitary stars began to glitter here and there
in the sky. The song of the finch had ceased,
and the ravens gone to roost among the tops
of the pines; but the more all animated things
became silent and quiet, the more seemed life
to become active in those things which are
called inanimate—it was as if the inner life of
nature awakened while the outward life went
to rest. There is a voice that speaks to the
soul in the stillness of night with words that
are not to be found in the dictionary. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
course, Professor Cracker would surely call
this an hallucination or lie; but, for all that,
I know it to be true. The boulders around
me looked like gigantic sentinels guarding the
entrance to the kingdom of the gnomes, and
asking me in their own language by what
right I dared to enter upon the forbidden
precinct. Here and there the trunk of a
stunted tree, a larch or fir with crooked boughs,
added to the grotesqueness of the picture,
complaining to me bitterly in silent but nevertheless
eloquent words that the soil in that
place was too poor and the climate too rough
to permit a full development of its qualities
and a luxuriant evolution of form. At last I
stood before a wall of rocks, at the bottom of
which a dark cavern held its jaws permanently
open, and a feeling of curiosity attracted me
towards the entrance. I felt a sort of premonition
that the mysterious depths of that
cavern was holding for me a new revelation.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>The night had now fairly set in, but the
moon arose in her glory. It was, as already
stated, the eve of St John’s Day, when fairies
and elves are said to come nearer to our world
to hold intercourse with mortals; the mysterious
night, when the ruby spark in the heart of
the fern may be seen. A feeling of awe came
over me as I looked into the cave and saw the
silvery rays of the rising moon shining through
the opening, revealing within the interior a
lake of considerable extent. I went nearer, and
now I beheld, as far as I could see, perpendicular
rocks bordering the lake, with projecting
nooks, holes, and crevices of unknown
extent, while, from the vaulted roofs, appearing
like huge stalactites of curious shapes, a
curtain of icicles descended, and the surface of
the water glittered and sparkled in the moonlight,
and the grotto looked like the cave of
the nymphs in a fairy tale. I strained my
eyes to behold the further end of the lake, but
the background was veiled in darkness, and
my sight could not penetrate through the
mysterious gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Something seemed to draw my soul towards
the realm of that shadow which the rays of the
moon could not reach, and, as I stood listening,
a soft melody was wafted over the waters.
Was it the breeze causing a rippling upon the
surface which produced that melodious sound
while playing among the icicles, or was it the
rhythmic dripping of drops of water from the
vault overhead, causing faint echoes within
these secret recesses? I cannot tell, but it
seemed to me like a tiny voice of a woman,
but of a woman of some ethereal kind. The
melody seemed to express a longing for something
unknown. It was like the cry of a new-born
soul, desiring to live and exist.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>It seems to me an impossibility to fully
express in words the sentiments that were
embodied in that song. It contained a desire
for death or transformation—terms which
mean the same thing, namely, the abandoning
one state of existence for another one. It
embodied a wish for entering upon a higher
plane of life and consciousness. The melody
which I heard formed itself into a language,
whose meaning may perhaps be approximately
expressed in the following words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“O what is this secret longing,</div>
<div class="indent">Welling up within my heart?</div>
<div class="verse">Unknown powers, surging, thronging,</div>
<div class="indent">Rending solid rocks apart.</div>
<div class="verse">New-born joys and dying sadness,</div>
<div class="indent">Bursting clouds and opening sight!</div>
<div class="verse">Something whispers, full of gladness,</div>
<div class="indent">This is love, is life and light!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>These words formed themselves within myself
without any conscious volition or ratiocination
of my own; and, what is still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
surprising, they had a certain magical effect
upon me. I felt as if I were myself entering
<i>into</i> a new state of consciousness, such as I
never experienced before or afterwards, and as
if I had become a new being, endowed with a
new kind of perception and memory; it was
as if I had been asleep all my life and suddenly
awakened for the first time. I now somehow
knew that I was I; but I could dissect or
analyse <i>my</i> Self. I knew that my Self was a
unity and not a compound, and therefore
incapable of being taken to pieces. I had
never known it before, and knew of no authority
on whose strength I would have accepted that
theory; nevertheless I was certain of it; because
I found that my self-consciousness was
not composed of parts.</p>

<p>And lo! as I stood at the border of that
lake, bending forwards, and with all my senses
on the alert listening to the song, I saw a
radiance within the depths of that darkness,
issuing from a circular luminous centre; and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
I concentrated all my attention upon it, this
light grew brighter, and there appeared in it
the shape of a human being—a woman of
supernatural beauty, in a mist-like, silvery
garment dotted with stars. Her long golden
hair was flowing over her shoulders, and a
radiant light shone upon her forehead. It was
that light, issuing, as I found afterwards, from
a precious gem, which illuminated her person
and all the objects within its sphere.</p>

<p>I dislike to tell what followed, because I
have no means of demonstrating its truth, and
there will be undoubtedly many inclined to
doubt it or to dispute it away; but if I had to
give evidence before a notary-public, I could
not describe what followed otherwise than by
saying that I was filled with an irresistible
desire to approach that ethereal being, and
that I made a step forward, quite without being
aware that I was stepping upon a lake. To
my surprise, the water supported me, and I
now think that it must have been solid ice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
for I passed safely over it, and a moment afterwards
I stood in mute admiration before the
most charming apparition of a lady of noble
mien. The lady of the lake looked at me
with wondering eyes and smiled. This encouraged
me, so I said:</p>

<p>“Who are you, angelic being? if you will
permit an intruder this question. Are you
one of the angels of heaven or a spirit of
nature?”</p>

<p>“My name is Adalga,” answered the lady,
and her voice sounded like the music of the
spheres. “I am the daughter of Bimbam I.,
King of the gnomes. But what are you? Are
you a spirit, hobgoblin, or spook?”</p>

<p>“I am neither the one nor the other,” I
answered. “I am——” but at this moment I
could not for the sake of my life remember
who or what I was; I had entirely forgotten
my name and all that referred to my past life.
At last, while I was trying hard to remember
who I was, it suddenly dawned upon me that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
I was an Irishman, born near the Lakes of
Killarney, and living at Limerick. I am
sure that if I ever was an Irishman, it must
have been before I was born; but at that
moment I was quite certain of it, and remembered
my home and my family. I therefore
said:—</p>

<p>“I am Patrick Mulligan, Esq., if it pleases
your worship.”</p>

<p>“There is a great deal of power in that
name,” replied the princess; “but what is your
essential nature?”</p>

<p>“A tailor, if you please,” was my answer;
but seeing that the lady did not understand
what I meant, I explained that I was in the
habit of making clothes. Upon this she asked:</p>

<p>“Are you, then, one of these semi-intelligent
forces of nature, capable of assuming a form,
which according to our traditions are believed
to inhabit the solid vastness of the element
called the air?—one of these airy elementals
whose bodies are subject to change—mischievous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
beings, that often cause explosions in
our mines?”</p>

<p>The princess stared at me and I stared at
her. What she said about the solid vastnesses
of the air was incomprehensible to me, until I
found out later on that the element of the
air is just as impenetrable to the gnomes as
the earth is to us; but what astonished me
most was, that after having doubted the
existence of elemental spirits of nature, I now
found myself by one of them regarded as an
elemental spirit of the air. At last I said:
“With your permission, I flatter myself to be
somewhat more than semi-intelligent, and if I
am a force, I am surely a substantial one. The
fact is that I am a man, a member of the
human family, a gentleman from the ancient
kingdom of Ireland and a descendant of Caolbha,
the 123rd king of Ulster.”</p>

<p>“A man! a gentleman!” exclaimed the
princess, full of astonishment and surprise—as
if it was the most unheard-of thing that one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
should be a man; and as if men and gentlemen
were not much more plentiful in our world
than gnomes and ghosts. This rather amused
me, and I said to the princess:</p>

<p>“I hope that I did not give offence to
your honour. It seems that you are leading
a very retired life, as you have never seen a
man.”</p>

<p>But the princess paid little attention to what
I said. Looking at me with her eyes wide
open, she repeated, as if trying to persuade
herself: “A man!”</p>

<p>“Of course a man,” said I. “What else
could I be?”</p>

<p>“I have been told of the existence of such
superior beings,” at last said the princess.
“Our sages teach that they belonged to a now
extinct race of divine or semi-divine beings,
who were kings of creation, and to whom all
the laws of nature were subservient. They
were said to be gods, and even superior to the
gods in wisdom and power; and that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
were spirits, who sometimes assumed material
bodies for the purpose of studying the conditions
of the lower kingdom of matter.”</p>

<p>My vanity became excited by the description
which the princess made of aboriginal man,
and I did not wish to depreciate the good
opinion which she had formed of me; so I
merely nodded consent.</p>

<p>“And from what region of the wide
empyrean have you descended?” continued
the princess, folding her hands, as if filled with
admiration and reverence.</p>

<p>“It is from Limerick that I come,” was
my answer.</p>

<p>“I have never heard of that region of
space,” said the princess, “nor did I ever see
any of the immortal beings who inhabit that
sphere; but it is sufficient for me to know
that you are a man, and that I am permitted
to worship you. My love to you is unbounded;
all that I am belongs to you; to
become united with you for ever is my only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
desire. Let me adore you. In you I shall
find eternal life!”</p>

<p>No words can express the looks of love and
affection which the princess bestowed upon
me while her rosy lips expressed these sentiments,
and she sank down before me in an
attitude of worship. I at once thought that
there must be a mistake somewhere, and that
she took me for something higher than I knew
myself to be; but I did not wish to disappoint
her. The straightforwardness of the princess
in speaking out her sentiments in plain
language and without any mock modesty
delighted me very much. I then did not
know that this was originally a natural quality
of the gnomes, who, being themselves born
out of emotions, cannot disguise the emotions
which cause them to live. So I replied:</p>

<p>“I highly appreciate your condescension,
madame. I do not doubt the sincerity of
your words; and as I am fortunately not a
married man, there is no objection to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
entering into very friendly and intimate
relations with each other.”</p>

<p>I do not know whether or not the princess
understood what I said; but she continued
to indulge in her expressions of love and
admiration. Bending low, and extending her
beautiful white arms towards me, she cried out
in rapture—</p>

<p>“Let me worship thee, O self-born, self-existent
one, thee who was before the world
came into existence, and who will remain what
he is even if all things perish! Thou, who
knowest no death, let me embrace thee, and
become one with thy divine nature! Let me
hail thee, O son of wisdom and lord of
creation, whose kingdom encompasses the sky,
the earth, and the whole universe, whose
Self includes and penetrates all, to whom all
power belongs and all glory is due. O infinite
one, having shown thyself to me in a limited
form, let me dissolve in the infinitude of thy
being. Tell me, O man, how I may serve thee!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>I was very much puzzled by this speech, and
somehow felt that I did not deserve it. I had
never known myself to be such a superior being
as the princess described; but I saw that she
was happy in her delusion, which afforded me a
good opportunity to get my wish fulfilled, and
obtain some knowledge in regard to the life of
the gnomes. There was now a good chance to
get the better of Professor Cracker and the
likes of him. I therefore said:</p>

<p>“It is I, madame, who would always be at
your service; but if you would do me a
favour, I would, with your permission, take a
look into the kingdom of the gnomes.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the princess crossed her hands
upon her bosom and bowing low, she
said:</p>

<p>“Thy wish, O beloved and all-knowing one,
is to me a command. Nothing shall hereafter
separate me from thy glorious presence.
Follow me, O my lord!”</p>

<p>Having spoken these words, her form dissolved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
losing its human shape, and becoming,
as it were, a ball of light with a fiery centre.
This ball floated away and I followed. Was
it that there was something the matter with
the rocks or with myself? The walls of rock
offered no resistance; we passed through
them as we would pass through a London fog.
It was such a strange experience that, if I did
not know myself, I should be inclined to
doubt my own words.</p>

<p>We might have been travelling for about ten
minutes at the rate of what I should judge
to have been about ten miles an hour, the
princess literally acting as my guiding star,
when the fog seemed to retreat on both sides,
and in the open space I saw at a short distance
a lot of other luminous balls, and in the
midst of each there was a human-like form
with a star upon the forehead, from which
issued the light that formed the luminous
spheres in which these beings lived and moved,
each having its own peculiar light. Directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
we entered, and were in the midst of the
gnomes. They were of various sizes and
colours. Some were nearly as tall as I, others
like dwarfs. They were not all of the same
brightness; some were more luminous than
others and their stars more radiant. They
had all some sort of an occupation. Some
were quarrying marble, from which they made
works of art and curious implements; others
were engaged in mining. By some means,
which I afterwards found to be the application
of a substantial energy, which might be called
liquid electricity, they rendered fluid the gold
that glittered in yellow veins within the snow-white
quartz, and after letting it run into
moulds the gold became again solid and hard.
There was no other light than what emanated
from the gnomes themselves, and I saw that
the amount of light in each individual indicated
the amount of his or her spiritual energy
and intelligence. Those that were luminous
seemed to be very clever; others, emitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
only a faint glow, looked dull and stupid, and
between these two extremes there were
luminous spheres and radiating stars of
different degrees of brightness, exhibiting
various tints and hues; but in the majority of
them a tint of green could be perceived.
They were what may be called “spirits,” in
spite of all that may be said to the contrary
by Professor Cracker, and their bodies were of
a substantial kind. Their forms were not
permanent, nor were they, as spirits, dependent
upon the existence of their forms.
In their normal and spiritual condition they
were like individual currents of air, that blow
here and there, having no particular shape;
but they assumed or projected corporeal and
organised bodies whenever it was necessary for
them to do so for the purpose of accomplishing
some labour requiring a form; and in such
cases each spirit assumed the same form again
which he had before he dissolved, and which
corresponded to his individual character; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
he did this, not as a matter of choice, but of
necessity, for such is the law of their nature,
that to each character belongs a certain form
of expression. A good gnome always assumes
the same beautiful shape which he had in his
previous embodiment, and whenever a wicked
gnome dissolved and again took form, he
acquired again the same distorted shape, the
same features and clothing as before.</p>

<p>But this is a digression, and I must continue
my account.</p>

<p>At my approach those who beheld me first
were very much frightened, and dissolved into
spheres of light, which grew less luminous as
they expanded. This called the attention of
the rest to my presence, whereupon what I
would call a general scattering and dissolving
took place; everybody vanished, and from all
sides resounded the cries: “A spook! a hobgoblin!
a ghost!”</p>

<p>Even the princess became affected by the
general panic, so that she lost her presence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
mind and disappeared, and the place would
have been completely dark but for the fact
that in the place of each gnome there was a
fiery spark, corresponding in colour to the
light that belonged to each individual. Thus
the whole place was dotted with sparks of
various colours, resembling jewels emitting
magnetic rays. In the place of Adalga there
was a beautiful pearl; there were brilliant
diamonds, sapphires emitting a fine blue light,
red-glowing rubies, glittering emeralds,
amethysts, smaragds, and other jewels of
various kinds—some very tiny, others of
considerable size, but all had the same
mysterious lustre, the same quality of fire; the
difference was only in the amount and colour
of the light they emitted.</p>

<p>I then remembered some tale which I had
heard of people who went into the Untersberg
and found untold treasures of gold and silver
and precious stones, but were too much
dazzled by the sight of so much wealth that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
they entirely forgot to pocket any of the
jewels, and thought of it only after returning
with empty hands. I therefore made up my
mind not to lose this opportunity, and started
to take one precious emerald, but a faint,
childlike voice cried out to me:—</p>

<p>“Touch me not! touch me not!”</p>

<p>I then stretched out my hand towards
others; but from each and every one came the
same answer—“Touch me not!” However,
I was not to be disappointed; so I gathered
my courage and made a resolute grab at a
great diamond; but on doing so I received
an electric shock that threw me upon the
ground. At the same time a clap of thunder
reverberated through the hall, and the next
moment the precious stones had disappeared,
and I stood in the midst of a crowd of gnomes,
who were talking and gesticulating in an
excited manner. They all looked upon me
with indignation, and even Adalga’s face
expressed disappointment and doubt. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
one of the gnomes, a very bright fellow, the
one who had been the diamond, came forward,
and, assuming a threatening attitude, shook
his fist at me and angrily exclaimed—</p>

<p>“This spectre has attempted my life. Why
should we be afraid of a ghost that has no
substance and is merely a compound of
delusions? Let us drive it away! Make
it vanish!”</p>

<p>In answer to this, and as if by common
consent, all the gnomes shook their fists and
cried—</p>

<p>“Put it out! let it be evaporated!”</p>

<p>“This is a queer reception,” I said to the
princess. “It is quite unexpected. I am
neither a spectre nor a ghost, and not
prepared to evaporate. I am a man!”</p>

<p>Then the princess came forward, and
holding up her hand as a sign that everyone
should be silent, she said—</p>

<p>“Do him no harm. Touch him not. He
is a man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“A man!” exclaimed the gnomes, pushing
forward and staring at me, while the one who
had spoken first asked the princess—</p>

<p>“How do you perceive him to be a man?”</p>

<p>“He told me so himself!” answered the
princess.</p>

<p>A general “Ah!” was the reply of the
gnomes. “He said so himself! He told it
to her!” they whispered to each other. The
threatening attitude of the gnomes at once
changed into one of respect. “A man!” they
exclaimed, and the cry was repeated until
from all parts of the open space it was echoed
back by many voices shouting, “A man!”
And through all the caves of the Untersberg
the cry was resounded, “A man has come
among us! A man! Let his name be
blessed! All hail to Mulligan, the saviour of
our world!”</p>

<p>Now from all sides gnomes came forward
and stared at me. Some were old and others
were young, men, women, and children, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
dressed in jackets, others in gowns, many
wearing hoods upon their heads, whose
pointed ends hung down over their backs.
I could not quite understand why they should
be so much surprised at seeing a man, and
expressed my surprise about it, saying that in
the world where I lived men were as plentiful
as bugs on a tree, while gnomes were exceedingly
scarce, so that hardly anybody seriously
believed in their existence, and that nobody
would dare to say openly that he ever saw a
gnome, for fear that somebody might laugh
in his face.</p>

<p>Much better would it have been for me if I
had been less loquacious, for I saw that some
of the more intelligent gnomes looked now
very indignant, and one of the wise ones came
forward and said—</p>

<p>“Although you said yourself that you were
a man, nevertheless I perceive in you only an
inferior being, perhaps a hobgoblin; for how
is it possible that men, being omnipotent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
all-knowing spirits, should not know that we
exist, and that they would be afraid of speaking
the truth? Only a blaspheming elemental
would dare to say that real men were subject
to animal passions. How could the creator
of all be ignorant of the existence of his
creatures? How could he who rests on his
own self-consciousness, and is affected by
nothing, suffer from fear?”</p>

<p>I did not know what to say; but while
trying to think of an answer to subdue the
rising storm, for I saw that the gnomes were
getting angry, the attention of the crowd was
attracted towards the further end of the hall,
where a large globe of yellow light appeared,
which in coming nearer became condensed
into a human form, appearing as a gnome of
venerable aspect, with a jewel looking like
a fiery topaz upon his head. He had a white
beard, and was dressed in a black cloak or
cape, and short trousers, stockings, and buckled
shoes. In his hand he held something that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
looked like a tube or telescope. He was, as
I heard them say, Prince Cravatu, minister to
the king.</p>

<p>As he approached, all the gnomes became
silent and waited in mute expectation for
what he would have to say. He came up to
me very close, and looked at me through his
tube, which turned out to be a spiritoscope.
The time during which he examined me
seemed to me an eternity, but at last he
finished, and spoke the ominous words—“<i>Umbra
simiæ vulgaris.</i>”</p>

<p>I knew enough Latin to understand that he
said I was the ghost of a common ape. A
general laughter arose, which was followed by
murmurs of dissatisfaction. Cravatu’s unkind
remark wounded my feelings, and I therefore
said—</p>

<p>“It is perhaps yourself who is a ghost and
a monkey, Mr Smarty! I am a man, and
never had any monkey in my family. My
father was Thomas Mulligan, a member of as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
good standing in the Church as anybody, and
my mother’s name was Bridget O’Flannigan,
and they were married by Father Murphy,
the parish priest.” And talking myself into
a sort of excitement, I proceeded to pull off
my coat, and continued: “Just come out of
here, you brute, and I will show you whether
or not I am a man. I will blacken your eyes
and turn you into a kettle-drum. I will make
you think that a thousand monkeys have come
to scratch your head, you blackguard!”</p>

<p>It was evident that among all present there
was none who understood my speech, and
Adalga seemed to listen to it with delight.
Cravatu looked again and said, addressing the
gnomes—</p>

<p>“He is from the land of dreams, and the
product of an illusion. There is not a spark
of spiritual energy discoverable in him. His
language appears to belong to a certain tribe
of monkeys inhabiting the dark and impenetrable
continent that lies beyond the confines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
of our kingdom, where all sorts of hobgoblins,
devils, and monsters exist, whose greatest
pleasure it is to torture each other. Among
them you will find different degrees of insanity:
they wander about in the dark, without knowing
from whence they came or what will be
the end of their journey; turning around in a
circular dance, sometimes whirling in one
direction and then again in another, always
returning to the place from which they
started, without making any progress. Nevertheless,
some of them are said to enjoy their
condition, because they do not know anything
better. They do not know their own selves,
and they are not alive; they only dream that
they live, and mistake their dreams for
realities. Some of them may even dream to
be men. They are dreams in a dream. They
have their imaginary dream-knowledge,
dream-pleasures, and dream-sorrows, and
imagine them to be real. After a certain
time they evaporate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Something in Cravatu’s manner made me
feel that there was a grain of truth in what he
said, and kept me from getting angry; but I
did not like to hear a gnome speaking so
disrespectfully of the human race. I therefore
said—</p>

<p>“I beg pardon. The place which you
describe may be Purgatory or something
worse, but not our world, in which it is, after
all, very pleasant to live. We are neither
fools nor idiots, but we have among us people
of great learning, scientists and inventors, and
we have many things which are quite beyond
the power of the comprehension of a gnome.”</p>

<p>“Listen to that phantom!” exclaimed
Cravatu. “How every word of his confirms
what I said. It would be impossible to
convince the product of a delusion that he is
only an illusion, because, believing himself to
be real, all his delusions seem real to him.
Not knowing their own real self, but only
what appears to be their self, they do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
perceive anything real, but see only that
which appears to be, and never that which
really is.”</p>

<p>Upon this a general discussion took place.
Some of the gnomes expressed their opinion
that I might be a man after all without knowing
it; others said that they perceived that I
was only a spook; some thought I was a cheat,
and others expressed their belief that I was
the product of an auto-suggestion. At last
some of the brightest gnomes held a consultation
together, and when it was ended, one of
the wisest-looking came up to me and said—</p>

<p>“We will allow you fair play. Men are
all-knowing, and, if you are a man, you will be
able to answer a question. Will you therefore
have the kindness to tell us what is the cube-root
of the diameter of a circle having a
periphery of 3,1415, if you please?”</p>

<p>This of course I did not know, and therefore
I said—</p>

<p>“I am not a mathematician, and you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
therefore have to ask me something easier.
But, even if I were an expert in mathematics,
I would require a piece of paper and a pencil
to figure it out.”</p>

<p>This remark of mine caused a great deal of
merriment among all the gnomes present. They
jumped and yelled, and punching each others’
ribs with the tips of their fingers, they cried—</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! He does not know the cube-root
of the diameter of a circle having a
periphery of 3,1415,” and from every corner
of the place, where groups of gnomes were
standing, and from every projecting rock,
where some of them were perching and listening,
shouts of derisive laughter came back,
repeating the suggestive and exasperating
words: “Ho! Ho! He does not know the
cube-root of the diameter of a circle having a
periphery of 3,1415.”</p>

<p>“This is very idiotic!” I cried. “How
could anybody know anything without figuring
it out or being informed about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>A triumphant smile appeared upon Cravatu’s
face, and Adalga looked downcast and perplexed,
but my remarks only increased the
hilarity of the gnomes, many of whom stood
upon their heads, and swinging their legs,
roared—</p>

<p>“He sees nothing! He knows nothing!
He imagines to know what he is informed
about! He knows nothing himself!”</p>

<p>In the midst of this uproar a blast of
trumpets was heard. Order was immediately
restored, and the gnomes whispered to each
other—</p>

<p>“The king!”</p>

<p>A sound as of many tinkling silver bells
announced the arrival of his majesty, and
immediately afterwards I saw a globe of red
light of unusual size, accompanied by many
smaller ones approaching, and directly I stood
in the presence of Bimbam I., king of the
gnomes.</p>

<p>The king, whenever he condescended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
assume a corporeal form, appeared as a gnome
of noble bearing, medium-sized, and of middle
age, having a yellow beard, while upon his
head rested a crown with many stars; the
greatest of them being a large carbuncle,
emitting a living red light, which enveloped
his person, and caused everything upon which
it radiated to appear in a red colour.</p>

<p>“What is all this row about?” asked the
king. “Has Kalutho again forgotten to collect
electricity from the clouds, and to supply with
vitality the roots of the buttercups on the
eastern side of the mountain?”</p>

<p>“Worse than that, your Majesty,” replied
Cravatu, saluting the king. “A spectre from
the country of dreams has dared to penetrate
into your kingdom, and it remains with your
majesty to decide what is to be done with it.
It is an animal hobgoblin belonging to the
third dimension of space.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he handed to the king the
spiritoscope, through which Bimbam I. took a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
long look at me, and returning it to the
minister, he spoke only one word—</p>

<p>“Empty!”</p>

<p>“What is most curious about it, if your
majesty will permit,” continued Cravatu, “is
that this three-dimensional apparition dreams
that it is one of those supernatural beings
which once existed upon the earth and were
called men!”</p>

<p>Upon hearing these words the king broke
out into such a roar of laughter that it was
fearful to behold. He held his sides and
laughed so that it shook the rocks and disintegrated
some of them, while all the gnomes
laughed with him. When the noise had
subsided, Cravatu again spoke and said—</p>

<p>“If it pleases your majesty to observe that
the semi-intellectual forces in nature produce
such elemental forms. They do nothing by
their own volition, but act only according to
the influences which act upon them. Anybody
can make them do as he pleases.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>So saying, Cravatu made a sign to one of
the gnomes, whom I afterwards learned to
know as Clavo, the commanding general of
the army. He was a robust fellow, and very
quick. Before I knew what he was about, he
drew a pin, which he carried in a scabbard by
his side, and stuck it into my back. I cried
out, and made a jump.</p>

<p>“It is evident,” said the king, “that he is
an elemental. Spirits do not squeal and jump
when they are stuck with a pin.”</p>

<p>This remark annoyed me, and I howled—</p>

<p>“I do not claim to be a spirit; I only said
that I am a man!”</p>

<p>His majesty grinned ironically.</p>

<p>“Who ever heard,” he said, “of a real man
who is not a spirit?”</p>

<p>Cravatu then motioned to another gnome
who carried a fiddle under his arm, and that
fellow, understanding the order, began to play
a jig. I am a great lover of music, and love
to dance, and this surely was the best Irish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
jig I ever listened to; but I did not want to
make an exhibition of myself before the king,
and resisted the impulse. At last, however,
the music got the best of me, my legs began
to jerk, and before I really knew what I was
doing, I danced the jig as lively as I ever
danced one in my life.</p>

<p>“He dreams that he is a man,” said the
king, “but he is only a product of nature. If
you stick his body with a pin, it jumps; if
you fiddle to his legs, he dreams that he must
dance. I do not perceive any spirit nor anything
supernatural in him; he is only a composition
of semi-intelligent forces of nature.
One can make such a compound do what one
likes. We can make it amiable or disagreeable,
gay or sorry, angry or contented, envious
or generous, jealous, furious, or whatever one
likes.”</p>

<p>While the king spoke these words, the
princess gave a faint cry, and as I looked at
her I saw that the silvery white of her star<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
had assumed a bluish tint. This was noticed
by all the gnomes, and they became very
much alarmed.</p>

<p>“Her royal highness, the princess, has fallen
in love,” cried Cravatu, in a sorrowful tone,
and the king quickly replied—</p>

<p>“Let the physician of the court be summoned
immediately.”</p>

<p>These words were hardly spoken when the
doctor made his appearance. He was an old
fellow, with a benevolent expression, wearing
a blue cape with yellow borders. He had a
grey beard, and wore a pair of golden spectacles.</p>

<p>Unlike our doctors, he did not ask the
patient any questions; he did not feel her
pulse, nor even look at her tongue; but, like
all gnomes, he knew things by direct perception,
and saw immediately what was the
matter with her. Turning to the king he
expressed his sorrow that such an unfortunate
accident should have happened to a member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of the royal family, and for the purpose of
removing the cause of the disease, he advised
the king that the object of the affection of
the princess—meaning myself—should have
his head sawed off immediately.</p>

<p>To my horror, Adalga consented cheerfully,
and the king was about to give the required
order, when the doctor spoke again, and
said—</p>

<p>“If her royal highness would consent to
wait until the next night, I would propose to
preserve the subject, and instead of sawing its
head off, have it dissected alive in the presence
of the medical faculty, as it would be very
interesting to our physiologists to see of what
material spooks are made. If the princess
would consent to have that much patience, the
whole profession would be thankful to her.”</p>

<p>The princess declared herself willing to wait,
and said that the sensation she experienced
was rather pleasant that painful to her.
Thereupon the king said in a stern manner—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“See that he does not escape. Put him
under the jumping-jack!” So saying, the
king and his suite turned to go.</p>

<p>“The jumping-jack!”—what a horror crept
over me when I heard these terrible words.
My frame began to tremble, and my hair
stood on one end at the very thought of this
jumping-jack, although I had not the faintest
idea of what it was, but imagined it to be
some instrument of torture. Soon, however,
I had my doubts cleared up; for the head
executioner, a strong fellow in a scarlet robe,
together with his attendants, brought forth the
instrument. It consisted of a yellow stick,
upon which a wooden monkey, painted purple,
was with its hands attached to a movable
crossbar at the top, leaving the body free to
climb up and down. This they placed before
me, planting the stick into the ground, and
by means of some contrivance unknown to
me, they set the wooden monkey a-going, and
quietly walked away, leaving me alone with
the princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>I do not know how it came, but that
wooden monkey exerted a powerful influence
over me. I had often seen such jumping-jacks
at toy-shops, but never experienced such
an attraction before. I could not divert my
eyes from that monkey. I called myself a
thousand times a fool for paying any attention
at all to a jumping-jack, and nevertheless it
kept me spell-bound. I could do nothing else
but sit there with my eyes rivetted upon that
monkey. I knew that the princess was still
with me, and I heard her imploring me with
tears, by all that was sacred to me, to desist
from paying attention to that jumping-jack.</p>

<p>“Dearest Mulligan!” she cried, “why will
you not desist from worshipping that monkey?
Why will you not make love to me? See, the
doors are open, and there is nothing to hinder
us to depart. Have I not promised you to
follow you wherever you go?”</p>

<p>“Let me alone!” I cried in rage. “I cannot
take my eyes away from that confounded jack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Is this your manhood?” continued Adalga,
weeping and wringing her hands. “Are you
a supernatural being, and the sight of a
monkey can make you forget yourself and
your promises? Is this your love and affection
for me, which a purple monkey can steal
away? O Mulligan! Mulligan! leave off
looking at that jumping-jack and remember
your duty! Come into my arms!”</p>

<p>“I wish that confounded hypnotism had
never been invented!” I cried; but for all
that I was not able to break the spell. The
princess kept on crying bitterly, and begging
me to desist. I heard her speak, but what
she said had no effect upon me. What did I
care for a princess, while I enjoyed the sight
of that dear jumping-jack? I knew that if I
did not control myself I would have to
remain in this situation and be tortured to
death at the appointed hour; but what was
that to me? I cared for nothing else but for
the sight of that monkey in whom all my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
affections were centred. I thought of the
princess with entire indifference. Oh, how I
loved that jumping-jack! It was as dear to
me as if it had been my own self. I could
not think of anything but of that jumping-jack,
and I involuntarily hummed the song in
which my situation was so well portrayed by
the words of a well-known poet:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Willie had a purple monkey</div>
<div class="indent">Climbing on a yellow stick.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>It never occurred to me to lick off the paint.
I knew nothing more. I was asleep, with the
jumping-jack in my arms.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE I was sleeping
I experienced a horrible
dream. The
jumping-jack before
me assumed the
features of a baboon, having a great
resemblance to Professor Cracker, and
besides this there were two grotesque figures
standing at the foot of the pole. One was
wooden nut-cracker with goggle eyes, a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
nose and protruding chin, the very image of
Jeremiah Stiffbone; and the other a curiously
shaped whisky-jug of stoneware, having the
form and features of Mr Scalawag; and while
the monkey was moving up and down on the
pole, the nut-cracker and the whisky-jug
danced, and all three sang the following song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Huzza and hey-day! Up and down we go;</div>
<div class="verse">There being nothing that we do not know.</div>
<div class="verse">We prove that black is white and white is black,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the world admires the jumping-jack.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And as we jump go jumping all the rest;</div>
<div class="verse">Who jumps the highest knows his business best.</div>
<div class="verse">Forward and backward on the beaten track:</div>
<div class="verse">There’s nothing greater than a jumping-jack.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And to our stick we cling from first to last;</div>
<div class="verse">Who asks for more is only a fantast.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus up and down we go, upward and back:</div>
<div class="verse">This is the glory of a jumping-jack.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After they finished singing, the nut-cracker
sniffed the air with his nose and turned his
goggle eyes in the direction where I was
hidden, after which his jaws began to move,
and he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“I am smelling human flesh. There is
some one present.”</p>

<p>To this the whisky-jug replied, while grinning
from ear to ear:</p>

<p>“Who knows but it may be Mr Schneider,
or his ghost.”</p>

<p>“Mr Schneider has no ghost,” said the
baboon. “If we were to find one, we would
have to destroy it immediately, to save the
reputation of science.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure that something of that
kind is hidden somewhere,” replied the nut-cracker,
and turning to the baboon, he asked:
“Do you see anything?”</p>

<p>“Seeing is deceptive,” answered the baboon,
“but we will see whether we cannot reason it
out. Wait till I come down.”</p>

<p>So saying, the monkey stopped his motions,
and to my horror I saw him unfastening his
hands from the crossbar. Climbing down the
yellow stick, he joined the whisky-jug and
the nut-cracker, and all three searched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
place and almost stumbled over me, but they
did not see me.</p>

<p>“There is nothing,” said the baboon.
“However, there can be no doubt that
Schneider is dead, and the only thing to be
regretted about it is that he did not die in
the interest of science. If we had known that
he was going to die anyhow, we might have
subjected him to certain experiments.”</p>

<p>Strange to say, during this dream I had
no thought of being a Mulligan; but my
individuality was changed back to Mr
Schneider. When I awoke Schneider was
gone, and I was once more Mulligan.</p>

<p>“<i>De mortuis nil nisi bene!</i>” drawled out
the nut-cracker. “But if Schneider had died
in the interest of science, it would have been
the first useful thing he ever did.” So saying,
the nut-cracker clapped his jaws.</p>

<p>The whisky-jug blinked with his little eyes
and added, “He meant well, but——”</p>

<p>I knew what he was going to say, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
made me very angry. I therefore jumped at
him and gave him a box on the ear; but my
fist went quite through his head, and it had
no other effect upon him than stopping his
sentence. He did not seem to notice it; but
I now knew that I had died and become a
spirit. I also saw that I could take possession
of people and use their organs of speech, and
as the nut-cracker was nearest to me, I went
inside of him and caused him to exclaim:—</p>

<p>“I will show you whether or not I am a
well-meaning fool! Confound you and your
science! I have been among the gnomes and
know that they exist! but you are the blind
fools who cannot see anything because you are
too stupid to open your eyes.”</p>

<p>“Brother Stiffbone has become insane,”
said the baboon; “let us tie him before he
does us any injury.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the baboon and the whisky-jug
went for me while I was in the nut-cracker’s
body, and I went in that shape for them. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
snapped at the baboon’s ear and gave him a
black eye, and I tore out a handful of hair
from the head of the whisky-jug, who in his
turn broke my—that is to say, the nut-cracker’s
nose. At last they got the best of me;
because the wooden limbs of the nut-cracker
were so stiff and I could not move them
quickly enough. We fell down, and the
baboon was kneeling upon my breast when I
awoke.</p>

<p>Once more I was Mr Mulligan. I opened my
eyes and found myself in inky darkness. The
first thing I did was to feel my nose to see
whether it was broken. The nose was all
right, and its solidity convinced me that I was
no ghost, and my adventure with the nut-cracker’s
body, however real it seemed, had
been only a dream. I groped about for the
purpose of finding the jumping-jack, but it
was gone; neither did I regret its absence, for
with the sight of it all my affection for it had
departed, and I could not understand how I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
could have been so foolish as to permit myself
to be attracted by it. My desire for the
purple monkey had left me; but my love for
the princess returned. I yearned for her
presence and called her name; but no answer
came; there was nothing around me but
darkness and solitude.</p>

<p>Ever since that event I have often asked
myself, Why do we hate to be for a long time
alone? The only answer I could find is,
that when we are alone with ourselves, the
company of our self is not sufficiently satisfactory
and agreeable to us. Perhaps we do
not sufficiently know that self to fully enjoy its
presence. Perhaps we do not know that self
at all, and then of course we are in company
with something we do not know, which means
in company with nothing, and to enjoy the
presence of nothing is to have no enjoyment
at all.</p>

<p>I confess that I never realised my own
nothingness so much as on that occasion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
The old doubts returned again. I did not
know whether I was living or whether something
which imagined itself to be “I” seemed
to live, and if that which only seemed to be
myself was to be vivisected, why should I
trouble myself about it, as the vivisection of
something unknown to me did not concern
me at all, unless I voluntarily chose to take
any interest in it? But how could I think
of making any choice at all if that “I”
was something unknown? I instinctively
refused to recognise as myself that personality
which was governed by the spell of a jumping-jack,
and I spoke to myself as if I were
another person.</p>

<p>“Well, Mulligan!” I said, “how could
you be such an idiot as to submit yourself to
the power of a baboon! Really, I doubt
whether you are a man. Pshaw! the gnomes
are right. You are a monkey yourself, and
even inferior to a monkey, because the baboon
was your master. A nice lord of creation you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
are, being controlled by the creation of your
own foolish fancy. A lord of creation,
indeed! One who cannot even resist the
attraction of a jumping-jack!”</p>

<p>Thus I went on moralising, and wondered
what my real Ego was, and whether it had
anything at all to do with what seemed to be
myself. I wished to know whether I—that is
to say, my real self—was; for what purpose I
was in the world, and where I had been before
I entered the world, and what that was which
caused me to be born, and whether I would be
born again after I—that is to say, my body—had
been dissected. Alas, for all these
questions Cracker’s science had no answer
to give, and I envied the gnomes who had the
ability to dissolve and condense into bodies
at will.</p>

<p>The darkness was very oppressive, and I
wished that I could be self-luminous like a
gnome, and not be dependent upon an external
light for the purpose of seeing. I wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
whether, perhaps, after the dissection of my
body, my spirit would have a light of its own,
or whether Bimbam was right when he pronounced
the suggestive word, “Empty!”
Then something, of which I do not know what
it was, made me think that the worst thing
anybody could possibly do was to doubt or
deny the presence of a spiritual light within
himself, and while I studied as to what may
be that which made me think so, I came to the
conclusion that it was my own spirit reminding
me of its presence, and this was a more
convincing proof to me that I actually had
a spirit than all the arguments offered to
the contrary by Professor Cracker and his
ilk.</p>

<p>With this conviction a great deal of calmness
and satisfaction came over me. At the
same time the darkness grew less in intensity;
a silvery mist, tinged with blue, arose like the
dawn that precedes the rising sun; the light
grew stronger and condensed in a luminous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
ball, and the next instant the princess stood
before me.</p>

<p>“Dearest Adalga!” I said, “where have
you been so long, and why did you leave me
alone in this horrible darkness?”</p>

<p>To this the princess answered, “Truth never
departs, but error always attracts us. Never
for an instant have I deserted you; I was with
you and around you all the time, but you
kept your eyes closed and refused to see.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” I replied, “I strained
my eyes to look through the darkness, but
there was nothing.”</p>

<p>“You strained your eyes,” answered the
princess, “for the purpose of seeing my form,
which was not formed, and which could not be
seen; but you made no effort to see that
which is without form, but which may be seen
with the inner eye. Know, my beloved, that
when you see my form you do not see me, and
when you do not see my form you may see me
in truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“This,” I said, “is contrary to all the
doctrines of our science, which teaches that we
can see nothing whatever unless it has a shape
of some kind.”</p>

<p>“The eye of science sees only the outward
form,” answered Adalga; “but the eye of
wisdom sees the reality itself.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” I replied. “I have learned
a lesson, and henceforth the delusion caused
by forms shall have no more power over me.
But tell me, dear, is the hour of vivisection
approaching? Is there no way for escape?”</p>

<p>“Alas, no!” sighed the princess. “There
is a jumping-jack at every door.”</p>

<p>A thrill of horror swept through me when I
heard these words, and made me tremble. A
moment before I had called myself a fool for
being afraid of a jumping-jack, and now at the
very mention of such a toy the old terror came
back. I knew that I could not escape, because
I would not dare to face a jumping-jack again.
I would be sure to succumb to its influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“But,” continued Adalga, “why should
you be afraid of being dissected? Can you
not create for yourself a new body again?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” I cried. “I am not a
creator.”</p>

<p>“But, sure enough,” answered the princess,
“you have a creative spirit in you. Oh, my
dear Mulligan, why will you remain incognito
among us? Why do you continue to be
dark? Why will you disguise yourself before
me? Is it that I am not worthy to behold
your true light, or that my eyes would be
dazzled by its splendour? Lord of my heart,
unveil yourself to me! Show yourself to me
in your own essence!”</p>

<p>“Dearest princess!” I replied, “I do not
know what you are talking about. I am not
luminous, and I never saw a luminous man.
In our country nobody has a light of his own.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the princess, “what a fearful
fate it must be to have no light, and to live
in a country of perpetual darkness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>To this I replied—</p>

<p>“This is not so. Nobody in our country
needs a light of his own, because we have one
great luminary, called the sun, right over our
head, and the light of that sun illuminates our
world.”</p>

<p>“And can everybody see that sun?” asked
the princess.</p>

<p>“Of course,” I said. “Everybody, unless
he is as blind as a bat.”</p>

<p>When I had spoken these words, the princess
threw her arms around my neck, and whispered
to me—</p>

<p>“Dearest Mulligan! I have a favour to ask
you. Please fetch me the sun!”</p>

<p>“This is quite impossible,” I said, “for
although we all live in the light of the sun,
nevertheless we cannot approach the sun, nor
put him into our pockets.”</p>

<p>But the princess was not satisfied with that
answer. “Surely,” she exclaimed, “you told
me that the sun was right above your heads.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
You ought not to refuse me the first kindness
I ever asked of you. I implore you to bring
me the sun. I will not be contented unless I
have it.”</p>

<p>I became alarmed. “This is a foolish
request, madame,” I said. “If somebody, or
anybody, could claim the sun as his own, and
carry it away, there would be little chance for
anyone else to enjoy it. The Government
would monopolise it, and put a tax upon the
use of his light; the doctors would dissect him
to see of what material he is made; and there
are lots of amorous fools who would not hesitate
a moment to make him explode, merely for
the purpose of amusing their sweethearts.”</p>

<p>But it was of no use to argue such a thing
with a being unacquainted with the first rules
of logic, and the princess went on with tears
and sobs to beg me to fetch her the sun. I
tried my best to explain to her the absurdity
of the request, but she would not listen; and,
weeping bitterly, she cried—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“O Mulligan, you do not love me! Is this
your gratitude for bestowing my affection upon
you?”</p>

<p>I felt very miserable, and began to look
upon myself as the most ungrateful wretch,
and to appease her I promised that I would
try to do all I could.</p>

<p>At this moment a blast of trumpets and the
tinkling of bells announced the arrival of the
king. He was accompanied by the queen and
her suite, and with them came all the nobility,
the ministers, officers, and also the whole of
the medical faculty, together with the head
executioner and his assistants. The queen
was a little fat woman, and rather homely.
Upon her head shone a great emerald, throwing
a soft green light around her. She was accompanied
by her maids of honour, all of whom
appeared in a green colour.</p>

<p>I made my bow to the queen, who, after
looking at me through the spiritoscope, turned
to the king and said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Is this the green hobgoblin who has the
impudence of claiming that he is a man-spirit?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the king; “only, as you
will observe, he is not green, but red.”</p>

<p>“Your majesty is pleased to jest,” replied
the queen. “Everybody sees that he is
green.”</p>

<p>“He is red,” said the king sternly, being
evidently annoyed by her contradiction.</p>

<p>“Let him be red then, if you must have it
so,” answered the queen, while her voice
indicated vexation; “but he is green for all
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” exclaimed Bimbam I.,
growing still more red. “I never saw a
woman in my life that did not love to contradict.
I say he is red, and I will leave it to
Cravatu to decide.”</p>

<p>Cravatu stepped forward, letting his yellow
light fall directly upon me, and after scanning
me very carefully, he said: “I beg pardon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
your majesties, but the hobgoblin is of a bright
yellow colour.”</p>

<p>“Are you all making sport of me?” cried
the king in a rage; and turning to the
princess, he asked: “What does Adalga say?”</p>

<p>“He appears to me in a silvery light shaded
with blue,” answered the princess; “but according
to his own statement he does not shine at
all.”</p>

<p>The gnomes looked at each other in amazement,
and Cravatu said—</p>

<p>“He is a wizard who appears to everyone
in another light.”</p>

<p>But the princess continued—</p>

<p>“Although he does not shine, he has a much
greater light than we all, for it shines upon
everything. He calls it a sun, and he has
promised to fetch it to me.”</p>

<p>Therefore the king ordered that I should
immediately show him the sun, and when I
succeeded in making him understand that it
could not be removed from its place in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
universe, and that the only way of convincing
oneself of its existence was to step within the
sphere of its light, the king ordered Cravatu to
select immediately a committee of three of the
most clever gnomes for the purpose of going to
the country of dreams and to hunt for the sun.</p>

<p>Accordingly three gnomes of rank were selected.
They were of a white colour, and the
light that radiated from them was so brilliant
that it dazzled one’s eyes to look at it. They
immediately assumed their spherical shapes
and floated away; but the king ordered that
my execution should be stayed until after their
discovery of the sun.</p>

<p>When I heard these words I felt much relieved
in my mind, for I had now some hope
of escape.</p>

<p>“May your majesty persevere in that resolution!”
I said to the king. “For these three
messengers will never discover the sun. They
have too splendid lights of their own to be
able to see beyond it. They will be dazzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and blinded by their own radiance, and not look
for the light of the sun.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing these words everybody seemed
highly astonished. The gnomes looked at each
other in surprise, and whispered: “He is a
prophet! He can foretell future events! This
is quite supernatural!”</p>

<p>“It does not require any supernatural power,”
I said, “to be able to foretell that a thing
cannot take place, on account of its being
impossible. Everybody knows that a certain
amount of darkness is required for the purpose
of enabling one to perceive light. Those who
are full of their own light cannot see the light
of another, just as those who love to hear only
themselves talking will not listen to what
another one says.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” exclaimed the king, and
Cravatu whispered to him: “He is one of
those who see what is not.”</p>

<p>But I continued saying: “If your majesty
wishes to obtain information regarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
existence of truth, I would advise you to send
a committee of such as are less conceited and
capable of seeing beyond the wall which their
egoism has built around them.”</p>

<p>I was still speaking when the three gnomes
returned, and they reported unanimously that
they had been to dreamland, and that they had
seen no other light but their own, and that it
was an absurdity to believe in the existence of
a universal sun; for if there were such a light
it could not have escaped their notice, and,
moreover, the presence of such a light would
make everybody look of the same colour, so
that not one person could be distinguished
from another.</p>

<p>Thereupon all the dark gnomes, such as had
as little light and intelligence as possible, were
gathered, and out of them the king selected
three almost entirely dark dwarfs. They were
surely the most sorry-looking imbeciles which
it has ever been my misfortune to behold.
Big-headed, hydrocephalic, with shrunken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
brains, they were the very personification of
abject stupidity; they seemed to have not
more understanding than an oyster, although
their power of seeing appeared good enough.
These were appointed as a committee to seek
for the sun, and it was ordered that they should
be conducted to the frontier of the outer world,
there to be left to their own fate and to begin
their researches. This was accordingly done:
the three idiots were taken away, and I pitied
them, for I doubted whether they would ever
have sense enough to find their way back.</p>

<p>“I am curious to hear the report of this
committee,” remarked the queen, “perhaps
it would have been still better to blindfold
them.”</p>

<p>To this I replied—</p>

<p>“I fear that your majesty will be disappointed;
for, even if the dwarfs perceive the
sun, they will be incapable to understand what
they see, or to describe it.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” exclaimed the king, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
the gnomes began to regard me with awe and
respect; but Cravatu said—</p>

<p>“Really there is more behind this person
than we suspected. He is one of those who
sees that which cannot be.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the king conferred upon me the
office of head fortune-teller to the court, and
I was treated with great respect. The whole
behaviour of the gnomes changed; the queen
smiled at me, and invited me to the palace;
but the princess was delighted, and as she took
my arm, she said to me with a triumphant
smile: “I knew that you were more than a
spook after all.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE arrived at the
king’s palace, a
description of
which will undoubtedly
interest
the reader, and I only regret my inability
to do full justice to this subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>The palace consisted of an extensive building
of white alabaster upon a rose-coloured marble
foundation, and with a gilded dome-shaped roof
over the main portion of the building, while
the adjoining parts were shaped in various
ways. The whole represented a mixture of
Grecian and Moorish styles; there was a high
portal whose columns were of white marble
with veins of gold. Entering through the
main door we came into a spacious courtyard,
filled with works of art, representing antediluvian
monstrosities of the various ages of
the world. There we saw the Ichthyosaurus,
Plesiosaurus, and Megatherium, and similar
animals unknown in history; enormous snakes,
turtles, and crocodiles, in what is supposed to
have been their original size and shape, and
besides these there were represented such
failures of nature as may have existed in the
earliest time of the world’s history—women
with fish-tails, human bodies with animal heads,
and animal bodies with human heads or limbs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
fauns, mermaids, satyrs, centaurs, flying snakes,
dragons, etc. Curiously enough, the gnomes
claimed that these were the representations of
their ancestors, and they paid great respect to
them. This courtyard extended all around
the palace, surrounding it like a ring.</p>

<p>From this court we entered into an entrance
hall built of yellow stone, at the door of which
were standing two gigantic umbrella-shaped
mushrooms of scarlet colour with white filaments,
resembling the finest kind of lace.</p>

<p>This hall was exquisitely furnished and
ornamented with various mushrooms, all of an
edible kind, affording at once comfort and food;
for while resting upon a lounge or sitting at a
table, if one wanted to eat, all he had to do
was to eat a piece of the furniture. There was
the Agaricus deliciosus, procerus, campestris,
prunulus, Boletus edulis, Polyporus confluens,
Hydrum repandum and imbriatum, the Clavaria
Botrytis, Morchella esculenta, Helvella
crispa, Bovista nigrescens, and many others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
whose names I have forgotten, and still others
which even Professor Cracker has not yet
classified. They were serving either as tables,
couches, or chairs; and there was not a single
toadstool or poisonous fungus among them.
There were no chandeliers, lamps, or candlesticks
of any kind, for the gnomes lived in a
natural manner and needed no artificial lights.
Each gnome was himself a light more or less
luminous according to the degree of his or her
intelligence. But to me, having no light of
my own and no power to illuminate anything,
it was a source of continual annoyance that I
always needed the company of some gnome to
keep me enlightened, as otherwise I would
have been left in utter darkness and nothingness.
Moreover, the light in which a thing
appeared to me always depended on the colour
of the light of this or that gnome who happened
to be in my presence, which caused me to
experience a continual change of opinions regarding
the qualities of the objects I saw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>From this hall a flight of seven marble steps
led into the main building of the palace. This
consisted of eight divisions, each made of a
different quality; while the whole was built in
a star-shaped form; so that each division with
its sub-divisions was connected directly with
the central chamber occupied by the king.
But what was most curious about it was, that
in each division some special invisible genii
or spirit seemed to preside; for in each a
peculiar influence differing from the rest could
be felt by anyone whose nerves were not made
of cast-iron or who was not a blockhead.</p>

<p>Thus the hall of the mushrooms on the
north side breathed an air of luxury and enjoyment;
while the room to the left of it was
pervaded by a spirit of anxiety and dissatisfaction,
and was visited only by those who by
force of habit had become attracted to it, and
who, so to say, found satisfaction only in being
always dissatisfied; chronic grumblers, misanthropes,
people discontented with themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and with everything. On the other
hand, there were two rooms to the east, in
which nobody could remain without being
overcome by a feeling of awe, reverence, generosity,
sublimity, and a deep religious sentiment.
They were visited by the brightest
of the gnomes, and served as places for contemplation.
These rooms seemed to be empty,
but they were not empty; because, while they
were bare of all objects, they were filled with
an overwhelming abundance of that spirit
which is the creator or producer of forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_143">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_143.jpg" alt="THE PALACE OF THE KING">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE PALACE OF THE KING.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>The south-eastern portion of the palace contained
the sleeping apartments of the royal
family, and whoever entered there would sink
into a state of torpor and forgetfulness; but
the hall next to that, lying directly towards
the south, inspired its inhabitants with a deep
melancholy easily turned into anger. Another
division towards the west was called the
chamber of cunning, and used on certain
occasions for the purpose of concocting schemes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>of revenge and intrigue. It was very seldom
used at the time of my arrival, but became a
favourite meeting-room later on. As to the
hall upon the north side, which was dedicated
to all sorts of sensual enjoyment, it was the
most attractive, but also the most dangerous
of them all, and I am bound by promise not
to divulge any of its mysteries.</p>

<p>All these rooms were free of access to every
gnome of good standing; but the division in
the centre, where the king resided, was open
only to those who gained admission there. It
was always guarded by a selected number of
female soldiers, corresponding to our Amazons,
and it was said that female soldiers were always
chosen in preference, because they were more
faithful and reliable than the males among the
gnomes.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the king’s chamber there
were statues of gigantic size, reminding me of
the ones at the British Museum which were
brought there from Easter Island. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
represented that prehistoric race of beings
which the gnomes used to call “<i>Man</i>,” or
“<i>Homo divinus</i>,” and of which they claimed
that it existed no more upon the planet earth,
having emigrated to other spheres, and abandoned
their country to hobgoblins, devils, and
spooks. I must confess that in our country
I never met with any human beings of such a
superhuman aspect as was represented here.
There were images of men and women of such
noble mien and so awe-inspiring, that they
looked much more like gods than like specimens
of the genus <i>homo bipex</i>, and a resemblance
to them can be found only among the
statuary of the ancient Greeks. Here the
king in person resided, and nobody dared to
approach him without his consent, and without
being admitted by the Amazons; but the
apartments of the princess were next to those
of the king, and as I spent a great deal of
time in her company, I also came very frequently
in contact with her father the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>The most remarkable thing among the
gnomes was that they could not distinguish
falsehood from truth. They were incapable
of saying anything else than what
they themselves thought and believed, and
they could not conceive of the possibility of
telling a lie. This state of affairs was sometimes
somewhat annoying, for it is not always
agreeable to hear some one state his opinion
about you right to your face; but on the
other hand it was advantageous in many
respects. For instance, whenever I wanted to
enter the chamber of the king, all I had to do
was to tell the Amazons that the king wanted
to see me; and I believe if anyone had told
the treasurer of the kingdom that he was
entitled to take the treasure away, the
guardian would have delivered it up without
hesitation. This, however, was only at the
time of my arrival, and before an attempt of
civilising the gnomes was made. Time passed
away rapidly, and I do not know how long I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
remained at the palace enjoying the hospitality
of the queen and the company of the
princess; but each day I learned more to
admire Adalga’s character; the simplicity of
her way of thinking, and the purity of her
affection. It is true that her want of modern
education, her inability to hide her true sentiments,
and her inexperience in the habits of
modern civilisation—especially in what refers
to conventionalities—sometimes created a feeling
of dissatisfaction in my mind. She did
not know how to pretend sentiments which
she did not experience; she knew nothing
about logical quibbles and tergiversation, nor
of the many sweet little lies that make life
supportable among mankind. It never occurred
to her to say anything just for the
sake of using a little flattery or tickling one’s
vanity, or for the purpose of teasing; and
of all such things which are much admired
among people of culture she knew nothing.
This I regretted, but I could not keep myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
from admiring her naturalness and sincerity.
We passed a great deal of our time in the hall
at the north end, and the princess asked me a
thousand questions in regard to the constitution,
customs and habits of the human kingdom,
the manners of its inhabitants, their
object of living and occupation, and the immortality
of their souls.</p>

<p>“I know, love of my heart!” she used to
say, “that if I could only become fully identified
with you, we would both be as one immortal
being, and it is only the dark aspect of
your nature which prevents this unification
and identity.”</p>

<p>“But why, dearest one!” I asked, “can
you not become immortal without this unification
that would destroy your identity? Have
you not within yourself all the elements
necessary for that purpose?”</p>

<p>“Alas, no!” answered the princess. “These
elements are within us, but they are capable
of development only in the constitution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
man, and therefore we strive to become human
just as you strive to become gods. But the
race of real human beings has disappeared, and
only a spurious imitation is left. These are
the ghosts and hobgoblins with whom intercourse
is forbidden, and we are now doomed
to be left for ages without any prospect of real
progress, until a race of real men appears
again upon the earth.”</p>

<p>I answered her questions as well as I could,
assuring her that there were still a great many
honest and noble-minded people among what
she called hobgoblins and ghosts, and that
they would be glad to contract marriages with
gnomes and sylphs, if they knew that they
could thereby be useful to them. I said that
there were among us millions of people who
did not know that they were immortal, but
that thousands of clergymen were engaged in
the occupation of making them believe it. I
also said that new systems of ethics, morals,
and philosophy were being invented almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
every day, and that the world of humanity
would soon become very much improved.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I were a man!” exclaimed
Adalga.</p>

<p>“This will be impossible in your present
incarnation,” I said. “But I will do all I
can to develop in you a human mind and
teach you all that men know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do please!” cried the princess, embracing
me in the exuberance of her joy.</p>

<p>“First of all,” I said, “you must learn the
rules of logic, syntax and induction, illation,
postulation, assumption and inference. You
must learn to doubt everything you see and feel,
and deny all you hear. Never believe anything
unless you already know all the whys and wherefores,
and never take anything for granted
unless it comes from an authority which you
believe to be respectable, and which is recognised
as such by the crowd. Deny everything
that you do not understand, consider everybody
a liar until he has irrefutably proved his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
veracity; never let anybody get the advantage
of you by showing yourself to him such as
you are, and never do anything without
getting a personal profit.”</p>

<p>I stopped, because I saw that these maxims
were all gibberish to the princess, and that she
did not understand what I said; but I resolved
to try my best to instruct her, and to
bring intellectual culture among the gnomes.</p>

<p>During these happy days, and while waiting
for the return of the three imbeciles, I
highly enjoyed the novelty of my situation.
My liberty was not restricted, and I had
ample opportunity for studying the character
and the habits of the gnomes, in which occupation
I was liberally aided by the princess.
Arm in arm we wandered or floated through
the villages, visited the mines and observed
the gnomes at their labour, and I was astonished
at the untold amount of treasures in the
Untersberg, the existence of which is little
suspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>The gnomes on the whole were at that time
an unsophisticated lot; because, owing to
their simple nature, a gnome could only think
one thought at a time. They were therefore
not given to reasoning and argumentation,
and lived fully contented. In fact, they were
rather deficient in intellectuality, but in spite
of that, or perhaps on account of it, they had
a great deal of spiritual power. Falsehood,
lying, hypocrisy, scheming, and wilful deception
were unknown to them, and as stated above,
they always meant what they said, and took it
for granted that everyone except a hobgoblin
or spook meant what his words implied; nor
would it have been possible for a gnome to
tell a wilful lie without experiencing therefrom
immediately a detrimental effect upon
his constitution; for as it was the light of
truth that made them luminous, the telling of
a falsehood, or even the thinking of one,
would have immediately diminished the amount
of his or her luminosity, which would have at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
once become visible to the rest; or it might
have extinguished their light for ever. Thus
they were, by the necessity of their nature,
always open and sincere, and followed their
impulses for good or evil without being guided
by the reasoning intellect. Whatever was done
by them was done in good faith, even if it was
foolish; there never was any malicious intent.</p>

<p>Being capable of perceiving the truth
directly and without reasoning, by the power
of pure reason or instinct, they could solve
the most difficult mathematical problems
by merely looking at the final result, and
nearly every one of them could thus have
made a fortune among us by giving exhibitions
of his power as a mathematical
phenomenon, without the least knowledge of
mathematics; but they could not even make
the smallest calculation or draw any inferences
from given factors. They knew what they
knew because they perceived it, and there
was no guessing about what they saw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>I found them to be exceedingly impressible
by my thoughts and emotions. I often
amused myself with the lower orders of
gnomes by making them act out what I
thought. When I, for instance, imagined
myself to be afraid of them, they would
become immediately afraid of me and run
away. When I became angry at them, they
became angry at me, even if I said not a word
nor showed it by my manners. I think that
if I had secretly determined to kill a gnome,
he would have unknowingly followed the
impulse and killed me. This made me think
of the story of Burkhart of Tollenstein, and
that perhaps many suicides may be thus due
to the ire aroused in those semi-intelligent
forces of nature which we find objectified in
the kingdom of gnomes.</p>

<p>There was one class of gnomes called
<i>Pigmies</i>, whose office it was to direct the
currents of vital electricity in the earth to
all places where the roots of the plants that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
grew upon the surface required it. This they
did while they were in their disembodied
state, when each of them was, so to say,
like a magnetic current; but whenever they
assumed corporeal forms they were very small,
and perhaps for this reason they had a dislike
against appearing in corporeal bodies, and did
so only for the purpose of taking food, or
for some other object which required material
organs. They were composed of some substantial
but bodiless active force, which they
could cause to crystallise into a nucleus of
latent energy. In such a condition they were
very lazy; but when liberated they were very
active. They were strong, and it was surprising
to see what an amount of active force
could be developed from a comparatively
insignificant spark of energy.</p>

<p>Next, there were the <i>Vulcani</i>, who were
principally occupied with mineral life, having
in their charge the growth and transformation
of metals. Their substance consisted of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
certain force for which we have no name,
but which might be called an electro-magnetic
fire. By an exercise of their will they were
able to send a current of such vital electricity
into a mineral vein, and cause gold and silver,
iron and copper, to grow; for it is a sign of
short-sightedness if one believes that metals
have no life and do not grow, because their
growth is not so rapid and perceptible as
that of the plants.</p>

<p>Then there were the <i>Cubitali</i>, and the
substance of which they were formed was a
kind of explosive force, which means that
they could contract their fluidic bodies and
expand them very rapidly, when the quick
expansion caused a kind of explosion with
a destructive effect. Whenever they assumed
a form they were about two feet high, well
built, and showing great muscular strength.
They were, so to say, the hard-working class,
and their principal occupation was the blasting
of air and the cutting of rocks; and, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
spite of their robust appearance, they had a
great deal of artistic talent, as was proved by
the products of their labour that could be seen
in the palace of the king.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there were the <i>Acthnici</i>,
constituted of “<i>Acthna</i>,” an invisible subterranean
fire, who, whenever they manifested
themselves in forms and became visible,
appeared like fiery globes and balls of lightning.
They were, on the whole, stupid and
dangerous, and it was said that on more than
one occasion some of them had entered dreamland—as
they called our world—and been
seen by the spooks and returned no more; all
of which may, perhaps, have been only a fable,
believed only by the children of the gnomes.
The <i>Acthnici</i> were said to create heat and cause
upheavings of the earth, and some of our
ancient philosophers believed them to cause
explosions in our mines. However that may
be, I never saw them at work, for they were uncouth
fellows, and I loved to avoid their society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>There were also the <i>Sagani</i>, and they were
the cleverest of all. They were tall and well-formed,
resembling the human shape in
stature and form whenever they assumed a
body. They were from three to five feet
high, but they had the power to elongate
themselves from the normal size up to a
length of twenty-five feet and more. Their
principal occupation was to construct the
astral models of plants after a certain type for
each species, which they did by the power of
their imagination (I have no other suitable
word); and here I beg to add in parenthesis
that, according to my observation among the
gnomes, every plant, stone, or tree upon the
Untersberg had its “Leffahs,” as it is called by
the gnomes, or astral type within the astral
body of that mountain; each being in some
way which I am unable to explain, connected
with the physical part of the corresponding
organism; so that the physical and (to us)
visible product was always the exact image and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
corporeal representation of its ethereal progenitor
and counterpart that is invisible to
us but visible to the gnomes.</p>

<p>All the gnomes could at all times and at
their own pleasure live in their ethereal states
without any definite form, comparable to air
or clouds or mists; or they could by an effort
of will assume material and corporeal forms,
each one according to his or her innate
qualities. In their ethereal shape they could
travel with the velocity of a thought, and
penetrate through the most solid rocks like a
current of electricity passing through a bar of
iron; but in their corporeal state their locomotion
was comparatively slow, and the
atmospheric air, not being their own element,
caused great obstacles to their locomotion.
For the purpose of passing through air, they
had to employ cutting and blasting and other
methods similar to those which we use for
tunnelling rocks.</p>

<p>It is believed by some people that when our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
bodies are asleep, our spirits are free to roam
consciously through space, and experience
things which we do not remember when we
awake, but which appear to us at best as a
dream. Something similar was the case with
the gnomes. In their ethereal states they were
individual powers, as distinct from each other
as electricity is distinct from light, or heat from
sound, and as such they were in possession of
consciousness and perception of a spiritual
kind, and capable of remembering all they had
experienced while condensed into a corporeal
form. But whenever they assumed corporeal
bodies, they had no distinct recollection of
what they had been doing while in a state of
dissolution, and this was explained to me by
the fact that while in their ethereal state their
brains were not solidified enough to register
and retain the impressions which they received;
but the higher impressions which they received
while in their corporeal forms they remembered
also in their ethereal state, and whenever a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
gnome entered into the ethereal state he knew
all that he had been doing in the same state
before. Moreover, there was a state in which
they lived in a semi-corporeal and semi-ethereal
condition, and this was when they
had not fully dissolved their forms, but
merely assumed the shape of a globe of
light.</p>

<p>From all this it will appear that it is as
difficult for a gnome to penetrate into our
world as it is for us to penetrate into theirs,
and even, as it often may happen, a gnome,
while in his incorporeal form, visits mankind,
he will not remember anything about it when
he returns, or it will appear to him like a
dream, and this may be the reason that our
world has gained the reputation among the
gnomes as being a dreamland, and nothing
more. It may be a dreamland to them as
theirs is to us. But they appeared to me to
live and exist in their own sphere as much as
we in ours. As to the rest, they were born,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
ate, drank, slept, married, and evaporated after
death.</p>

<p>Each family and each tribe of gnomes had
its own head and leaders, whom they implicitly
obeyed, without even knowing the possibility
of disobedience, because they were not given
to arguing, and all were ruled by Bimbam I.
The administration of the kingdom was very
simple; there were no taxes to pay, and everyone
had what he wanted, because nobody
wanted more than he had. The king took
whatever he needed, and never more than he
cared to have. Custom-house duties, monopolies,
privileges, and corporation nuisances
were entirely unknown, and there was no
newspaper to disseminate gossip, cause dissensions,
and ruin characters for the sake of
getting up a sensation. There were no shams.
The nobility consisted of gnomes that were
truly noble, and not merely pretended to be
so; the doctors actually knew something, and
did not merely make believe that they were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
possession of knowledge; the goodness of the
good could be estimated by the amount of
light that radiated from their stars, and their
character was indicated by the colour of the
star. Consequently each individual sphere of
light slowly changed when a new emotion or
virtue grew in a gnome. Anger made them
red, love blue, intelligence yellow, sensuality
green, wisdom violet, and so forth.</p>

<p>The ladies of the gnomes occupied positions
similar to those of our wives and daughters.
The lower classes joined the males in their
work; the higher ones were of a more ornamental
character, and protectors of arts. The
world of gnomes, the same as ours, would have
been dreary without female beauty and loveliness.
Many of the gnomesses were exceedingly
beautiful and ethereal, others were
homely; but all of them were very amiable,
because they acted in a natural manner, made
no attempt of disguising their feelings, and
knew of no such thing as deceit; neither did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
they disfigure their forms by absurd fashions
in dress.</p>

<p>Love-making and wooing were carried on
among the gnomes as it is with us, only with
the exception that the females had the same
right as the males to bestow their affection
and to make proposals; neither was it considered
a disgrace for any lady to do so; on
the contrary, it would have been a disgrace for
her to pretend to have other sentiments than
she had, and it would have injured her beauty
and destroyed her light. There was, however,
no such thing as what is understood among us
as “women’s rights,” for their natural instincts
taught them that not everything that becomes
a male also becomes a female; these gnomes
made no attempt to overstep the limits drawn
by nature, for this would have caused them to
become degraded and unnatural. On account
of their simple-mindedness immorality was
entirely unknown, because true morality has
its basis in the instinctive perception of truth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and requires no artificially concocted systems
and shams. One may be very moral without
even knowing that moral doctrines exist, and
another may know all the moral prescriptions
by heart, and be a rascal for all that.</p>

<p>There was one class of females distinguished
from the rest. They were such as, having
attained a certain age, were still without
children. They corresponded to what is in our
world called “old maids”; but they were
neither old nor ugly. In fact, they were on
the whole very charming, and could sing
beautiful songs, as everyone knows who has
lived for a certain time in the vicinity of the
Untersberg, and heard them sing. Their songs
are usually of a sad character, and alluring;
they express their loneliness and longing for
children. The love for production exists in all
departments of nature, and also among the
gnomes. A gnome having no knowledge of
his own, is always happy to stuff his head with
theories belonging to others, and loves them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
if they were his own children. The same is the
case with the so-called “wild women” of the
Untersberg. Their love for offspring sometimes
causes them to come out of the Untersberg
and appropriate to themselves children
of men, such as they find lost or astray within
their realm. For this reason they are called
“wild,” although I wish to gracious that I
would never meet with anything less wild
than they. I always found them very lovely,
and I now understand the meaning of those
popular tales which speak of children of
peasants that have been abducted by these
spirits, and taken into the Untersberg, where
they lived among the “wild women,” who
treated them kindly, and played with them;
and after a certain time sent them back to
their parents loaded with gifts.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap2">ADALGA, like all
the rest of the
gnomes, was a
spirit, in the
same sense as we are spirits ourselves; the
term “spirit” implying a centre of consciousness
or intelligence, irrespective as to whether
the form in which that spiritual power or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
energy dwells is visible to somebody or everybody
or nobody. In this sense the essence of
everything is spirit, and every living form is
a dwelling-place or vehicle for a conscious
spiritual energy, be it latent or active, as it
could not otherwise be, if the world, as demonstrated
by our best philosophers, is, with all its
seen and unseen forms, nothing else but a
manifestation of All-consciousness, an attribute
of the Divine Mind.</p>

<p>In taking this view I am well aware that I
am assuming an attitude directly opposed to
that of Professor Thomas Cracker, in his capacity
as a representative of that modern science
which regards the universe as being made up
of dead lumps of matter, in which, in some
inexplicable way, life and consciousness are
produced by means of mechanical motion, due
to the friction caused by their coming accidentally
in contact with each other. I am also
clairvoyant enough to foresee that Mr Cracker
and his learned colleagues will treat this story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
with contempt, if they should ever condescend
to notice it; but this cannot be helped, and I
resign myself to my fate.</p>

<p>I will therefore not enter into a discussion
concerning the merits of a philosophy resulting
from looking at the universe in its spiritual
aspect, or compare it with the absurdities resulting
from a blind belief in materialism
and its superstitions, but proceed to say that
Adalga being a spirit, in possession of an intelligence
not due to mechanical friction, but
due to the presence of an intelligent power in
her own constitution, this intelligence of which
she was possessed became manifested in her, and
as time went on its manifestations increased,
as might have been scientifically proved by
the observation that she became more clever
and intelligent. From this it may be inferred
that the princess was in possession of a mind
capable of cognizing things by means of her
bodily senses, and the facts which I witnessed
every day went to corroborate the correctness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
of this theory. Moreover, there were indications
that her mind was capable of cognizing
the actuality of spiritual truths or principles;
but being only a gnome, she was not capable
of intricate reasoning and complicated
argumentation.</p>

<p>I often argued with her about the supposed
immortality of the soul, and it seemed to me
that Adalga was not substantial enough to be
more than an ideal, and could therefore not be
an enduring reality, because ideals require
substance for becoming realised. In other
words, the princess often appeared to me like
a thought, that may delight the present generation
but be forgotten by the next. What
she needed was “matter” or firmness, such
as results from fixedness or stability of the
spirit, and I came to the conclusion that I
could supply her with the required material
elements by her union with me. I know that
I will be accused of making wild statements,
unsupported by any well-authenticated scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
theory, but it will be seen that by means
of my logical and inductive reasoning I arrived
at the end at the same result, which Adalga
seems to have perceived instinctively, and
without any scientific training of her imagination,
merely by her own direct perception.</p>

<p>It may be inferred that Adalga had a soul,
because she was alive and capable of having
emotions, and in that soul seemed to be dormant
a spark of a higher or spiritual life or
consciousness, producing in her longings for
the unknown, such as were expressed in her
song in the cave; longings which she herself
could not explain, be it that her mind was
not sufficiently developed to understand her
own nature, or that she was deficient in a
scientific training of her imagination.</p>

<p>The tribe to which Adalga belonged was that
of the <i>Sagani</i>, the noblest of all the tribes
among the gnomes, whose intellectual capacity
was nearest to that of man. Being a Sagana,
it was in her power to elongate her body, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
circumstance which was at first terrifying, and
afterwards somewhat annoying to me; for often
while we were sitting side by side, with arms
interlinked, and engaged in the sweet occupation
of exchanging our sentiments, would she
forget herself, and suddenly elongating her
body shoot up some twenty-five feet high by
sheer force of habit, upsetting me or carrying
me up into space before I had time to let go of
her arm or take it away from my waist. I
begged her to restrain herself, and not to do so
again in my presence; but self-restraint is a
power entirely unknown among the gnomes.
It is only possible for those beings who are in
possession of a certain amount of spiritual self-consciousness,
or, in other words, who feel or
know that they are somehow superior to their
own nature, as I am bound to say, even if I
risk being accused of believing in the existence
of something supernatural. The gnomes
do not realise anything higher than their own
elemental nature, and can therefore not restrain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
it. Only man can do or keep from doing certain
things from a sense of duty and superiority.
It is true that even animals seem to
restrain themselves, but it is their fear or
other instincts which restrains them, and not the
experience of anything higher than their natural
animal state; they do not experience any
superiority over their animal nature, because
no such superiority is existing in them; their
motives for action are all to be found in their
own natural world, while man’s motives may
sometimes spring from something superior
than his own animal nature, namely, from a
higher and divine nature in him.</p>

<p>To my remonstrances the princess used to
answer:</p>

<p>“It is my longing for the high, the sublime,
and exalted which causes me to elongate my
body involuntarily. I wish to grasp the infinite,
and this makes me shoot up involuntarily.”</p>

<p>“This, my dear,” I replied, “is not the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
way, and would not be permitted in polite
society among us. Moreover, you cannot
reach infinitude in this manner, which reminds
me of the performances of certain scientific
theologians, who continually keep searching
for God by means of a telescope. We cannot
reach the infinite by stretching our limbs; we
must grow and unfold from within by the
power which we accumulate. This power, as
it grows and expands, will cause our souls to
unfold and develop. Instead of seeking for
support outside of ourselves, we ought to be
like a storage-battery, filled with a living
power, that will radiate all over the world.
This power is called love.”</p>

<p>“And can your clever men of science make
love?” asked the princess.</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” I answered; “love-making is a
favourite occupation with many of our people;
but the love they make is not the genuine
article, but merely a spurious imitation.
Genuine love cannot be made or manufactured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
it is eternal; all we can do is to establish
the conditions under which it may become
manifest.”</p>

<p>“Oh how I wish I could learn all that you
know!” exclaimed Adalga. “Will you not
instruct me?”</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure!” I answered.
“The first thing which you will require to
learn is to distinguish the true from the false.
You gnomes know that which is true, because
you perceive it, but you do not distinguish it
sufficiently from that which is false, because
falsehood is unknown to you. The first requirement
for you to attain a higher state of
civilisation is therefore to become acquainted
with all sorts of falsehoods, deceptions, and
lies.”</p>

<p>Adalga seemed to be frightened, and I
therefore continued to explain.</p>

<p>“Listen!” I said. “You know that which
is, because you perceive it; but you must also
learn to know that which is not, so that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
may distinguish it from that which actually
is, and not mistake mere appearances for
realities.”</p>

<p>“But if that which is not has no existence,
how can we know it?” asked the princess.</p>

<p>“We cannot truly know that which is not,”
I said, “except by experiencing its nothingness.
We must ourselves become liars and
cheats, otherwise we will always have only a
vague idea of what lying and cheating means.
We must be able to perceive that which is
not, so that we may get some idea of that
which is.”</p>

<p>“But how can I perceive that which is not,”
asked Adalga, “if there is nothing to perceive?”</p>

<p>“In the easiest way in the world,” was my
answer. “It only requires a scientifically
trained imagination. We will then be able to
see anything we like, even if there is nothing.”</p>

<p>The princess was delighted. She looked at
me with a face expressive of great admiration,
and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“As the glowing tiny spark of the ruby
grows into a large red light when it is joined
by the flame, so my admiration of thee grows
in beholding thy knowledge. No longer art
thou veiled to my eyes, for the secret has been
revealed, and I behold in thee not a man, but
one of the sons of Lucifer, the god to whom
no gnome can approach.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” I said. “The story of Lucifer
is only a nursery tale, an exploded humbug,
annihilated by science. What do you mean?
Who is the Lucifer of whom you are speaking?”</p>

<p>“The god of darkness! He who knows
that which is not and does not know that
which is; he whose temple is beyond the
limits of our city, whose portals no gnome can
enter without losing his light. Follow me!”</p>

<p>Thus saying, the princess dissolved, and
assuming her spherical shape floated away,
while I followed her as fast as my legs would
carry me, for my curiosity was greatly excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Beyond the city of <i>Gnana</i>, the capital of
the kingdom of the gnomes, there is a wilderness
composed of forests, jungles, and swamps.
There you find sandy deserts interspersed with
an occasional spot of verdure, and innumerable
bogs over which will-o’-the-wisps are aimlessly
wandering. Some parts are entirely bare of
vegetation, others are covered with a luxuriant
growth of curious trees, resembling the Poison
Ivy (<i>Atrus toxicodendron</i>), upon which grows
a tasteless fruit. There was also a species of
crab-apple trees, and another bearing a certain
kind of nuts, which were awfully hard to
crack, and contained nothing but ashes. In
some places the spot was covered with fine-looking
but poisonous toad-stools, and the
ways were full of entangled vines and briers.
The main road was leading to nowhere; for
after following it until you were exhausted to
death, you would find yourself exactly upon
the spot from which you started at the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>In the midst of this labyrinth there stands
a curious-looking castle, looking very solid and
strong, with many fortifications; built of sandstone.
There are thick walls, surrounded by
moats, buttresses, and counterforts guarded
by banquettes, abuttes, scarps and palisades,
fraises and parapets, ditches and <i>trous de loup</i>,
all of which look very formidable; but the
light has such a peculiar influence upon the
material of which the castle is built, as to
cause the walls to decompose and rapidly
crumble away. The very foundation of the
building has so little solidity as to cause the
walls slowly but continually to sink, so
that it requires a continual repairing and
building at the top to cause the castle to
remain above the ground and to maintain a
respectable appearance.</p>

<p>It was in front of that castle that the princess
reassumed her corporeal form, and as I
approached nearer I found the walls ornamented
with skeletons and skulls, and upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
the top of the building waved a flag, consisting
of a great many pieces of cloth of many
different sizes and colours, sewed together in
a haphazard manner, and this flag bore the
inscription:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Knowledge is Power.</i></p>

<p>At the entrance of the fort there was a kind
of a temple made of jet-black stone. A few
steps led up to a door.</p>

<p>“These walls,” said my companion, “are
the remnant of what was once a city built by
a now extinct race of demons,” and pointing
to the temple, she added, “Here is the
temple of him who knows that which is not,
and does not know that which is.”</p>

<p>“And what is to be seen in there?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Who knows?” exclaimed the princess.
“This place is shunned by every gnome, and
no one dares to enter. It is said, however,
that it is inhabited by insane spooks, and by
the remnant of a certain class of people who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
have spent their lives in doing many useless
things. They are said to follow their accustomed
occupations in an automatic manner,
doing the same things over and over again
without coming to an end.”</p>

<p>“And who were they, when they lived?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows,” answered Adalga.
“None of these creatures knew himself while
he lived; how could anybody know him after
he died?”</p>

<p>I expressed my determination to enter,
upon which the princess grew very much
alarmed, and begged me to desist; but the
more she sought to dissuade me from my
purpose, the greater grew my curiosity to
investigate the mysteries of Lucifer’s temple.</p>

<p>“Do not enter, O Mulligan!” cried the
princess. “It will destroy your light.”</p>

<p>“I have no light to lose,” I answered. “I
am not a gnome.”</p>

<p>“Woe to me!” she cried. “Shall I lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
you and my life even before our union has
become completed! Stop this rash undertaking!
Stop, O Mulligan, stop!”</p>

<p>“I must see the mystery of Lucifer!” I
exclaimed, while tearing myself away from
Adalga’s arms and making a rush for the
door, which I entered, while the princess
remained outside, wringing her hands and
filling the kingdom of the gnomes with her
lamentations and cries.</p>

<p>The room into which I entered appeared
at first perfectly empty and dark; but after
a little while I was able to see two luminous
spots of a reddish yellow light at a distance,
and some dark and voluminous object loomed
up. Vague and undefinable nebulous shapes
seemed to be flitting before my eyes and
moving about. I confess that at first I
experienced a feeling of something like fear
and repugnancy; but nerving my courage, I
went forward, and soon stood before a gigantic
figure representing a green frog squatting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
upon a stone, and from the eyes of the frog
shone the phosphorescent lights which I had
observed when I entered, looking like two fiery
balls. The jaws of the frog were wide open,
as if it were ready to devour anything whatever
coming within its reach. Gradually my
eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and
I could read an inscription upon the pedestal
saying—</p>

<p class="center"><i>Nulla Ratio Sine Phosphore.</i></p>

<p>Many years after that event I presented
this inscription to the Academy, and respectfully
asked for an explanation of its meaning.
There were a few who claimed that it said it
was necessary for the brain to contain
phosphorus, so that the principle of mind
could become active therein, and make a
man capable of reasoning; but the great
majority of the Academicians claimed that
reason itself was a product of phosphorus,
and a mode of motion of its molecules in the
brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>I was no longer afraid. I climbed upon
the pedestal and examined the head of the
frog, when I found that in the place of a
brain there was a large lump of phosphorus
enclosed in a film of coloured glass. It was
the light of the phosphorus shining through
the coloured glass that caused the lurid glow
which came from the goggle eyes of the frog.</p>

<p>This discovery made me laugh. “This,
then,” I said to myself, “is the celebrated
Lucifer of whom the gnomes are afraid.
Evidently the scientists of that extinct race
attempted to create a living and thinking
being in an artificial manner by making a
compound of phosphorus to serve for a
brain; but for all that they produced nothing
but the dead image of a bull-frog.” I felt
tempted to smash the frog or to take the
phosphorus, but for some cause, which is not
quite clear to myself, I made up my mind to
let it alone.</p>

<p>I now became also able to see more clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the nebulous forms that wandered about in
space, and to my horror I found among them
not only the shades of some prominent people
well known in history, but also the apparitions
of some persons with whom I was well
acquainted. Among them was one who had
spent all his life in trying to invent a
<i>perpetuum mobile</i>, and who to my knowledge
is still living. As I approached him, I found
him engaged in his usual occupation. He
seemed to be aware of my presence, for he said—</p>

<p>“There is only one little hinge which
prevents the instrument from going. When
this is overcome it will work all right, and my
name will be inscribed in the register of the
Academy.”</p>

<p>“And of what benefit,” I asked, “will it be
to you to have your name thus inscribed,
when you yourself are only a ghost?”</p>

<p>It is said that ghosts, like the gnomes,
cannot speak otherwise than as they think,
because they have not sense enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
prevaricate. He looked at me in surprise,
and merely answered—</p>

<p>“Fool!”</p>

<p>He had become so much emaciated, and his
voice sounded so hollow, that I began to doubt
whether he actually was the one I had known
in our world; I therefore asked him who he was.</p>

<p>“Alas!” replied the ghost mournfully, “I
do not know who I am. While I was among
the living I knew everything about science
and philosophy, medicine and theology,
spiritism and psychic research, but unfortunately
I never knew myself. It is said that
I made many inventions and discoveries, but
as I do not know myself, I do not know who
invented and discovered these things, and
whether it was I or another; moreover I have
forgotten them all.”</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “why do you not try to find
out who you are?”</p>

<p>Another deep sigh expressed the profundity
of his grief as he said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“Life is short, and I have no time to attend
to that matter. First, I will finish this
<i>perpetuum mobile</i>, and after that I may
have leisure to find out who I am and for
what purpose I exist. I have now put these
wheels together for the ten thousand six
hundred and ninety-fifth time, and there is
only one little hinge. After this business has
been accomplished I will turn my attention
to more serious matters.”</p>

<p>I felt a deep pity for the ghost, in whom I
now well recognised my friend, for the words
spoken by him I had often heard him express
before. I therefore said—</p>

<p>“There is nothing to be said against entering
into scientific experiments and increasing
one’s store of knowledge in regard to the laws
of external nature and its phenomena; but a
far more important thing it is to know one’s
own self and the object of one’s existence, so
that one may act accordingly, and make the
best use of life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“I know it,” answered the ghost, “and I
often said so myself, but I have now no time
to attend to philosophical questions; I must
finish this wheel.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I said, “you would succeed
better if you were first to learn to know your
real self and its powers, and construct your
wheel afterwards, if you should still think it
worth the while to spend your time with such
nonsense.”</p>

<p>When I said this the ghost became very
angry, and said—</p>

<p>“Avaunt, fool! and do not torment me.
Get thee gone!”</p>

<p>So saying, the ghost snapped his jaws at me
in a furious manner, and I barely escaped
having my ear bitten off.</p>

<p>I mournfully turned away, sadly grieved
that such a bright intellect should have been
allowed to evaporate in dreams; but I knew
that it was of no use to argue with him, for
my own experience with the jumping-jack had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
taught me what a great power a fixed idea has
over the mind.</p>

<p>Another ghost, fearfully emaciated, now
attracted my attention. He looked more like
the shadow of a skeleton than a man, and was
evidently at the point of starvation, but
engaged in the ludicrous occupation of composing
a bill of fare, while he himself had
nothing whatever to eat. I looked over his
shoulder and saw him write out the following
prescription:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dejeuner à la fourchette.</span></p>

<p class="center">
<i>Huîtres.</i><br>
<i>Consommé tapioca à la Julienne.</i> <span class="gap">     <i>Potage crême d’asperges.</i></span><br>

<i>Bœuf à la mode aux maccaroni a l’Italienne.</i><br>
<i>Selle de mouton Hollandaise.</i><br>

<i>Desert.</i>  <span class="gap">    <i>Café.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“And where are all the good things whose
names you have written?” I asked.</p>

<p>“This,” he answered haughtily, “you will
have to find out yourself. It is sufficient if I
indicate to you the order in which I might eat
them if I had them. Does this not satisfy
you?”</p>

<p>“It might satisfy my curiosity,” I replied,
“but it will not cure your hunger or make
you fat. You seem to me to need something
more substantial than mere theories.”</p>

<p>“Knowledge is power!” said the ghost.
“When you have acquired the knowledge how
to eat in good style you may apply it as soon
as you get the chance.”</p>

<p>“Look here, my friend,” I answered, “it
seems to me that you need very much a chance
to get something to eat, even if it were not
served up in the style proposed by you.
Would it not be better to let this bill of fare
alone, and seek for some food?”</p>

<p>“I have no time to attend to that,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
the ghost. “I must first settle the theory;
the practice may wait.”</p>

<p>“But by that time,” I said, “you may be
starved to death.”</p>

<p>This remark seemed to annoy the ghost, for
it was true, and ghosts never like to hear any
truth that goes against their own pet theories.
Being themselves made up of delusions, a
spark of truth is to them a foreign element,
and burns them like fire.</p>

<p>“Go away!” he cried angrily. “Do not
waste my time. I shall not permit any scoffing
at science.”</p>

<p>As I turned away I saw another ghost of
still more pitiful aspect, clothed in rags, the
very personification of abject poverty. Want
and misery were looking out of his hollow
cheeks, and his eyes were buried deep in their
sockets. He was making a long calculation.</p>

<p>“What are you calculating?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Do not disturb me,” he said. “I am
calculating the interest which I would receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
if I were to inherit all of Mr Vanderbilt’s
money and estates, and how much, with the
compound interest added to it, it would
amount to in one hundred years, and I want
to see whether this would be enough to enable
me to live comfortably in my old age. I have
now been over this calculation for many years,
but I must begin it again, because the value
of the stocks has again changed, and there is
a difference in the amount of the interest.”</p>

<p>I was surprised to hear that a person of
such a beggarly appearance should have such
excellent financial prospects, and I said:</p>

<p>“When do you expect to make that inheritance,
and could you not get now some
money on credit on the strength of your
prospective income?”</p>

<p>To this the ghost replied:</p>

<p>“Alas, no! I have no prospect of making
any inheritance whatever, and there is no one
who would lend me a penny; but it is such a
comfort to know how much money I might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
enjoy if I had it, and what an amount of
interest the capital would bring if I were in
possession of it.”</p>

<p>“And could you not do some work for the
purpose of earning some money?”</p>

<p>“Alas, no! I have no time for that; I must
finish this calculation first.”</p>

<p>“But what good will it do to you,” I asked,
“to know all that stuff, as long as you are in
such a state of poverty?”</p>

<p>The ghost shivered. He looked at me scornfully,
and said in an angry tone—</p>

<p>“Knowledge is power! Do not waste my
precious time. Begone!”</p>

<p>Thus going from one to another, I found all
these spectres employed in occupations which
had no practical purpose, and served at best
to amuse their imagination or gratify their
curiosity. They all spent what little energy
was left in them for the purpose of wasting
their time, making themselves believe that
they were doing something useful. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
were all occupied with that which is not, and
did not know that which is. They amused
themselves, so to say, in worrying about the
question what nothing might be if it were
something, and in doing so they turned the
only something they had, namely, their energy,
into nothing. They were all dreams themselves,
products of dreams, existing in dreams,
leading a dream-life and doing nothing but
dreaming; all they did was imaginary and had
its origin in their own imagination. One of
the ghosts, becoming angry, flew at me and
stumbled and fell down. Thereupon it never
occurred to him that he could get up again,
but he remained floundering upon the floor,
uttering pitiful lamentations. Some ghosts
were playing cards, and although their continual
losing was a source of annoyance to
them, they had not the power to stop; others
imagined that they had to imitate everything
that they saw another ghost doing. This class
was very large. One ghost practised target-shooting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> 
but as he was all the time looking in
quite another direction than where the target
was, he always missed the mark; but wept
bitterly and complained of his want of luck.
But it is not possible to mention all the follies
which I saw the ghosts commit in the
palace of Lucifer; they were like insane people,
reasoning cleverly but without being in possession
of reason. I pitied them, and sick at heart
I turned towards the door.</p>

<p>In the meantime, owing to the cries of distress
uttered by the princess, great crowds of
gnomes had gathered in front of the temple,
but none dared to enter. The king and the
queen and all the court had arrived. They
were all running and floating to and fro and
talking and gesticulating, everybody giving
some good advice which nobody followed;
they did not know what to do. That anyone
could enter Lucifer’s temple and come out
again alive, or otherwise than blind or insane,
seemed to them an impossibility. The king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
looked very grave and the princess was in
despair.</p>

<p>“After all,” I heard the queen say to the
princess, while trying to comfort her, “Mulligan
is nothing but a hobgoblin.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Adalga, “I know he is a
man!”</p>

<p>While speaking these words the princess
elongated her body to its full length, and
looking towards the temple, saw me standing
upon the threshold, and in spite of the cries
of her mother, who tried to stop her, she flew
to me and the next instant she was in my arms.
The door had not yet been closed, and from
the interior a ray of yellowish light, coming
from the eyes of the green frog, fell upon the
princess. I sought to shield her with my
person, but it was already too late, for that
ray mingling with the blue in Adalga’s sphere,
immediately produced therein a permanent
shade of green.</p>

<p>A shout of joy arose from the multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
when they saw me issue from the temple, and
never-ending hurrahs resounded; but this was
changed to groans of distress when they
beheld the change of colour which had taken
place in the princess. The king was very
much distressed, and while pulling his hair
and beating his sides, he cried:</p>

<p>“Unfortunate was the hour when this
magician entered my kingdom. Was it not
enough that our beloved daughter had the
misfortune of falling in love with this wretch
and taint her beautiful silver white with a
nasty blue? Having given her the blues, he
now causes her to expose herself to the rays of
the frog. Oh that I had never been born, or
seen the hour of such misery! Let the executioner
come immediately and execute the
sentence of death.”</p>

<p>A storm of indignation arose, and the vivisectors
appeared. However, I was not afraid;
I knew now the character of the gnomes and
knew what to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“May it please your majesty,” I said, “as
well as our gracious queen and all the venerated
assembly, to behold their beloved princess
in this beautiful garment of green, whose
splendour surpasses everything that has ever
been seen before or may be seen afterwards. I
call those present to witness that the princess
never was so charming as since she has turned
green. Green is the colour of hope, and
indicates the beginning of wisdom. In the
kingdom of man green is the favourite colour.
Green is the grass of the earth, the trees and
plants, and even the ocean waves turn green
when they come kissing the shore. But why
should I waste words in praising a colour
whose superiority is acknowledged by everyone
who is capable of judging its beauty?
Has not her gracious majesty, the queen herself,
shown the superiority of her taste by choosing
the emerald as the jewel of her heart, and
adorning her person with green as the true
expression of her excellent qualities? Verily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
I am giving only expression to the feeling of
every intelligent gnome who loves his dynasty
and his country, if I request you to join me in
the cry—‘Hurrah for green!’”</p>

<p>And “Hurrah for green!” was shouted by
all, over and over again. Owing to my
eloquent speech green at once became the
fashionable colour, and everyone wanted to
become green. They lauded and praised me
as the benefactor of gnomekind, and the ladies
thronged around me, congratulating me, and
begging of me to give them a shade of green.
When order was somewhat restored I made a
few more remarks, calling everyone a traitor
who would not join me in my predilection for
green. I said that the princess and I loved
each other, and that I would have married her
in spite of her being blue; but now, as she
had turned green and resembled her mother,
she had become a thousand times dearer to my
heart.</p>

<p>Here, however, I am bound to confess for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the sake of truth that my statements were not
strictly correct, for the queen’s colour was of
the pure and beautiful hue of the emerald,
while the colour of the princess was an impure
or dirty green, not at all comparable with the
former. However, we all knew that on certain
occasions a few little rhetorical liberties must
be permitted.</p>

<p>The king was very much pleased; he
believed every word I said. He called me
his benefactor and saviour of his country. He
conferred on me on the spot the office of Grand
Chancellor of the Kingdom and Superintendent
of Public Schools. He decorated me with the
insignia of the Order of the Bull-frog, and
consented that the ceremony confirming my
engagement to the princess should take place
immediately, to be followed by the marriage
as soon as the three dwarfs would return with
their discovery of the sun.</p>

<p>When the king had finished giving this
decision, he embraced me and the princess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
and this was also done by the queen and her
maids, by the ministers and high dignitaries
that were present, and by their wives and
daughters, mothers and mothers-in-law; but
the rest of the gnomes danced and shouted
and stood upon their heads, swinging their
legs as a token of joy. The princess was
radiant with smiles, and we all were very
happy. Cravatu even said that this was the
happiest day that had ever been seen in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>We returned to the palace, where preparations
were made immediately for a great
festival. The best mushrooms that could be
found were collected and prepared by the best
cooks. Some were boiled, others stewed, and
some dished up raw. The queen herself
assisted in the kitchen work. The court
musicians arrived, the palace was decorated
in great style, and deputations came, not
only from all parts of Bimbam’s country, but
also from neighbouring states. I received a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
fine suite of apartments adjoining those of the
king and the princess, together with a lot of
attending servants to keep my rooms continually
illumined, for which purpose the most
radiant gnomes were selected.</p>

<p>But I will not impose upon the patience of
the reader by describing the festivities which
took place when the still beautiful princess
Adalga became Mr Mulligan’s bride. I will
only say that during the most solemn moment
of the ceremony, when the mutual promises
were exchanged, it seemed to me that I distinctly
heard the triumphant croaking of a
frog; but no one else noticed it, and it may
have been only an effect of my own imagination.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; WAS now tolerably
well satisfied. From
the abject state of a nobody, existing only as a
“subject” for scientific observation, looked
upon as a hobgoblin, and doomed to vivisection
prisoner of a jumping-jack, I had suddenly
become somebody of importance, owing to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
cleverness and to the credulity of the king. I
saw myself now raised to the highest dignity
in the kingdom of the gnomes, and engaged to
a most amiable and charming—even if a little
green—princess, and there was momentarily
nothing to be desired except the discovery of
the sun and the completion of my marriage.</p>

<p>This discovery of the sun caused me a certain
uneasiness; but I hoped that the king
would not continue to insist upon that condition.
A considerable time had elapsed, and
nothing was heard of the dwarfs or their expedition.
It seemed to me not at all improbable
that they had fallen into the hands of
Professor Cracker, and were now bottled up in
alcohol, adorning the shelves of some museum.
At all events, I had not the faintest hope that
even if they were to return, they would have
discovered anything worth speaking of, or be
able to describe it, and I therefore thought of
means for persuading the king to alter the
stipulation in regard to my marriage, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
permit it to take place before the discovery of
the sun. This I did not think very difficult,
for the king was very changeable and did not
seem to know his own mind. Although,
whenever he got some idea into his head, he
was very stubborn and self-willed, nevertheless
he was easily led by the nose by those who
knew how to flatter him. His capriciousness
was shown by the rashness with which he
ordered my execution, and his instability by
changing his mind and making me Grand
Chancellor of his kingdom.</p>

<p>For this purpose I sought and obtained an
interview with the king, and asked his consent
that the marriage between myself and the
princess should not be delayed. I proved to
him by arguments that the sun could not do
otherwise but exist, and that it was merely a
question of time to discover it; that this event
would perhaps not take place as soon as we
wished it, but that this would make no
difference to the sun. I took especial pains to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
explain to him that the interests of the state
would suffer by my being doomed to live as a
bachelor.</p>

<p>But the king had never studied logic, and
was inaccessible to my arguments.</p>

<p>“I want the sun!” he cried, growing more
than usually red in his face.</p>

<p>To this I replied—</p>

<p>“If your majesty will permit, we all know
that life, and light, and heat come from the
sun. The sunlight does not penetrate into
your kingdom because the rays of the sun are
refracted upon the surface of the earth; but
the caloric rays of the sun penetrate through
these rocks, otherwise there would be no heat
and life, and everything would be cold and
dead in this place. Now, as you feel the
warmth within your residence, you will easily
see that there must be a sun.”</p>

<p>“I see nothing,” answered the king. “All
that you say may be as you say, but it does
not enable me to perceive the sun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“And would it not be just as well,” I said,
“if your majesty would accept my information
that there is a sun? If I tell you so, you will
know it, and knowledge is power.”</p>

<p>But the king would not agree. “I perceive,”
he said, “that you tell me that there is a sun;
but for all that I do not perceive the sun itself,
and cannot eat it or have it deposited in my
treasury.”</p>

<p>This stubbornness of Bimbam I. irritated
me somewhat, and I said—</p>

<p>“All that your majesty says goes to show
that the gnomes will have to travel still a long
way before they will come up to our standard
of science. We, the scientists of the human
kingdom, do not need to acquire or possess
or even to see anything, much less to eat or
absorb it into our own constitution; it is quite
sufficient for us to have a theory about it
which is believed to be correct. This is what
we consider to be real knowledge.”</p>

<p>“What a fools’ paradise this must be,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
exclaimed the king. “In our country we
enjoy that which we are and possess, and care
very little about theories and opinions.”</p>

<p>While we were engaged in this conversation
Cravatu entered, and brought the news that the
three dwarfs had returned, and that everything
had come out exactly as I predicted; for these
imbeciles, not having sense enough to find
their way back, had been found in the vicinity
of the place where they had been left. All
that could be made out by their incoherent
speech was that they had seen something, but
what that was nobody knew, for they were
totally unable to describe it.</p>

<p>This fulfilment of my prediction raised me
still higher in the estimation of the king, who,
seeing that I could foretell future events, looked
upon me as a kind of supernatural being, and
wanted to be instructed in that art.</p>

<p>“It is very easy,” I answered. “If your
majesty will only study logic, and, instead of
directly looking at a thing, reject the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
of your senses and begin to argue from the
basis of what you assume to be true. Logic is
the method of reasoning from particulars to
generals, or the inferring of one general proposition
from one or several particular ones;
which means that instead of looking at a thing
as a whole, and afterwards examining its parts
and the relations in which they stand to it, we
must look at some separate part and imagine
the rest. It is a process of demonstrating to
our own satisfaction and to the satisfaction of
everyone who believes in our judgment——”</p>

<p>Here I was interrupted by the loud snoring
of the king who had gone to sleep in his chair.
The sudden stopping of my speech had the
effect of awakening him. He yawned, and
elongating his body to its full length, he
stretched his limbs, and then went on to say—</p>

<p>“This is very interesting, and I want to
have this method introduced in all the schools
of my kingdom; but for the present the most
important thing is the discovery of the sun,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and I want you to discover it without further
delay.”</p>

<p>I suggested that this might be done after
my wedding; but the king sternly replied,
“No sun, no marriage! That’s all.”</p>

<p>Being so near to the completion of my
happiness, I was exceedingly grieved to see
my hopes wrecked by their fulfilment being
made to depend upon an impossible condition;
but a happy thought struck me, and I
said—</p>

<p>“I assure your majesty that the sun is
right over our heads, and there is nothing to
prevent you from seeing it as soon as you
will get out of this mountain, except the
atmospheric air, which, unfortunately enough,
is impenetrable to your sight, while I can
easily enough see through it. Under these
circumstances, the only thing that can possibly
be done will be to cut a hole through the air,
and make a tunnel deep enough until you will
reach the outer limits of the atmosphere, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
there will be nothing to prevent you from
seeing the sun.”</p>

<p>This proposal pleased the king exceedingly,
and Cravatu could find no words strong
enough to express his admiration of my
wisdom. They both knew already enough of
logic to understand that they would be able to
see the sun if there were nothing to hinder
them from seeing him. Accordingly orders
were immediately issued that the best
labourers, miners, and mechanics should be
selected for the purpose of cutting a hole in
what they called the “sky,” for the sky for
them began there where their own element,
the earth, ended.</p>

<p>On the very next day the work was begun.
They selected a place on the very top of the
Untersberg. The Pigmies drilled the holes,
the Vulcani did the blasting, the Cubitali
furnished the required materials, and the
Sagani superintended the work, giving
directions. We had the pleasure of seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
that already during the first twenty-four hours
a hole of about ten feet depth and with a
diameter of ten feet was made as the
beginning of the tunnel for enlightenment.</p>

<p>Thus day by day, or, to speak more correctly,
night after night, the work went on; for when
it is day in our world no work is done by the
gnomes, as with the beginning of sunrise they
fall into a state of lethargy, from which they
awaken only after the night has set in.
Every night the king and the queen with her
maids, the princess, myself, and the high
dignitaries of the kingdom, went out to see the
progress made in the work of the tunnel, and
every night the hole grew deeper to a certain
extent, according to the quality of the
material which had to be cut; but when it
began to dawn upon the surface of the earth
the gnomes went to sleep and slept so well
that nothing could have awakened them from
their slumber.</p>

<p>In the meantime I considered it my duty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
give great attention to the education of the
gnomes, and to the development of their
power of drawing inferences from things
unknown. For the purpose of enabling them
to distinguish the true from the false, I
established schools of logic all over the
country, in which all sorts of lies were taught,
so as to give them a chance for using their
own common sense and finding out the truth
for themselves by overcoming the falsehood.
Soon I was in possession of a corps of capable
liars for assisting me in this work; but the
education of the princess I took into my own
charge.</p>

<p>At first Adalga did not enjoy the lessons,
which is only natural, as the birth and
beginning of everything is painful and
difficult, but after a while she became delighted
with my instructions. As my method
may prove to be interesting and instructive
to my compatriots engaged in pedagogical
enterprises, I will illustrate it by an example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>First of all I tried to explain to the princess,
by practical experiment, that a good scientist
can never know anything whatever; he can
only know what a thing is not, but not what
it is, and from what he perceives that it is
not he draws his inferences as to what it
may be.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, taking a stone and
handing it to Adalga, I said—</p>

<p>“Queen of my heart! will you tell me
what this is?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure!” she answered. “It is a
stone.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it?”</p>

<p>“Because I see it.”</p>

<p>“Sight is deceptive,” I said. “It may be
a pumpkin.”</p>

<p>“I do not care what it may be; I know it
is a stone.”</p>

<p>“How can you prove it?”</p>

<p>“I do not need to prove it. I know it, and
so does everybody who knows a stone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“You cannot know it,” I said, “unless you
can give any rational reason for your belief.”</p>

<p>“I do not need to give any reasons for it.
I am satisfied to know what I know.”</p>

<p>I saw that I could not get the better of her
in this way, so I said—</p>

<p>“Will you have the kindness to imagine
this stone to be a pumpkin?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr Mulligan!” she answered, “if
this gives you pleasure, I shall imagine it to
be a pumpkin.”</p>

<p>“Now take a bite of it, my darling,” I said.</p>

<p>“I can’t, and you ought not to ask me
anything so absurd.”</p>

<p>“But why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Because it is too hard.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” I exclaimed. “And now as
you have discovered that it is too hard for
being a pumpkin, you have a scientific right
to infer that it is not a pumpkin and may
possibly be a stone; <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>This way of making a simple thing very
complicated, according to the strict rules of
exact science, pleased the princess very much
and amused her greatly. It now became
necessary to show to her how we may arrive
at a knowledge of universals by drawing
logical inferences from particulars. For this
purpose I told her that we must never trust to
our reason, but only put faith into our method
of reasoning. Pointing to the stocking which
the princess was just knitting, I asked her
what it was.</p>

<p>“A stocking,” she said. “I thought you
knew that much already.”</p>

<p>“Who is going to wear it?”</p>

<p>“I.”</p>

<p>“And what are you?”</p>

<p>“A princess of this kingdom.”</p>

<p>“Do all the princesses of this kingdom wear
stockings?”</p>

<p>“All those whom I know.”</p>

<p>“Very well!” I replied. “The consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
is that all the people who wear stockings are
princesses of the kingdom of the gnomes.”</p>

<p>This seemed strange to Adalga, but she
could not prove that it was not so, and I proceeded
to explain to her that the power to
draw logical inferences was the highest power
which a scientist could possess, and that by
means of logic almost anything could be
proved, be it true or false. Thus I proved to
her by way of an illustration, first, that white
was black; secondly, that black was white;
and thirdly, that there was no colour at all.</p>

<p>“White, my dear!” I said, “is, as everybody
knows, no colour at all; for it is produced
by a combination of all the prismatic
colours in the same proportion as they exist
in the solar ray, where each colour neutralises
the other. Now, if there is no colour, there
can be no light, and where no light exists
everything is as black as night, and if everything
is black, white must be black also, and
consequently white is black.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“Very strange!” exclaimed Adalga.</p>

<p>“If white is black,” I continued, “it follows
that black is white, because if there is no
difference between two things they must be
identical. Moreover, everybody knows that
black is no colour at all, but the negation of
colour, and it follows that if a thing has no
particular colour of any kind, it must necessarily
be white.”</p>

<p>“Incredible!” exclaimed the princess.</p>

<p>“There is nothing incredible about it,” I
said. “It is all very reasonable. Moreover,
there is no such thing as a colour at all, for
what we call by that name refers only to a
certain sensation which is produced in our
brains by means of certain vibrations transmitted
through the retina and the optic nerve.
If you look at any coloured thing in the dark
you will find it to be without any colour at
all. The sensations we receive are only due
to certain vibrations of something unknown.”</p>

<p>“What is a vibration?” asked Adalga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Vibration,” I said, “is nothing but a certain
kind of motion, and as motion <i>per se</i> does
not exist, vibration is nothing, while that
unknown thing which moves must be everything.
But the existence of that unknown
thing is not admitted by science, and consequently
science knows nothing of everything,
and of everything nothing, just as you
like; and you can make nothing out of everything,
and everything out of nothing, at your
own pleasure.”</p>

<p>The princess was delighted to hear that she
could now make everything out of nothing,
although for the beginning it could be done
only theoretically, and her repugnance to
philosophical hair-splittings faded away. She
continued her lessons with great diligence,
and very soon I had the pleasure of seeing
that she believed nothing and denied everything.
A few weeks more, and I was highly
gratified to find that she could no longer tell
a mock-turtle from a tommy cat without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
entering into a long series of arguments for
the purpose of proving which was which.
Unfortunately, in proportion as she lost her
power of perceiving the reality, while improving
in the practice of logic, her own light grew
more and more dim, her luminosity less, and
the green colour in her sphere darker; but I
considered this as a matter of only secondary
importance; for it is said that beauty is a
perishable thing, while wisdom remains.</p>

<p>Sometimes she was inclined to worry about
the fading of her charms, but I reasoned her
out of it, saying: “If everything is nothing,
then, as a matter of course, beauty also is
nothing, and it is not worth the while to
worry about the loss of nothing.”</p>

<p>“But,” objected Adalga, “if beauty is
nothing and nothing is everything, beauty is
everything, and we must do all we can to
preserve it.”</p>

<p>“Beauty,” I replied, “among our people is
the outcome of fashion. If it were to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
fashionable in our world to wear goitrès and
hunchbacks, everybody would find it beautiful
and adopt it at once; and even if he did not
find it beautiful, he would pretend to find it
so. Thus it often happens that everybody
wears a most ridiculous article of dress, not
because he thinks it beautiful, but because he
thinks that others do so. In this way the
people act foolish, and silently laugh at each
other for being such fools.”</p>

<p>“This I should think to be very immoral,”
objected Adalga.</p>

<p>“Human morality,” I replied, “is also a
matter of custom. What is considered very
moral among one nation or class of people is
considered immoral among others. Some, for
instance, regard stealing as a disgrace, others
as a proof of great ingenuity. But we will
not enter into these social questions. We
would never come to an end. What you need
for the purpose of evoluting into a higher and
nobler sort of a being is, first of all, the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
steps, or mental operations, by which you will
proceed from particulars to generals, and from
generals to still higher generalities by means
of rejections and conclusions, so as to arrive at
those axioms and general laws, from which we
may infer, by way of synthesis, other particulars
unknown to us, and perhaps placed
beyond the reach of direct examination.”</p>

<p>“Oh my!” exclaimed the princess, and I
saw that my explanation was not very clear to
her; but this is excusable in a gnome, and I
did not despair.</p>

<p>There is nothing more certain than that
religious speculation without science leads to
superstition; but it is also true that scientific
speculation in regard to philosophical
questions leads to blind materialism and
insanity, if it is carried on without any
religious basis, which means spiritual perception
of truth. Adalga overdid the thing,
because she was of an impulsive, fiery nature,
and not used to self-restraint, and when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
discovered the mistake it was too late to
remedy it. I had taught her never to take
anything for granted, and the end of it was
that she doubted my words, disputed and
denied everything, and always did the very
contrary of what we expected her to do. It
is said that a little learning is a dangerous
thing, and I would add that the greater the
learning the greater the folly, if at the foundation
of all that imaginary knowledge there
is no instinctive perception of truth, or what
we call intuition.</p>

<p>The head of the princess became developed
at the expense of her heart. The vital powers,
which ought to have been distributed harmoniously
through her system, went almost
exclusively to furnish her intellect, and the
consequence was that her head increased
enormously in size, while her heart began
to shrink. Her sight became dim, so that
she could no longer distinguish right from
wrong; her joyfulness left her; she became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
dissatisfied with herself and with everything;
a continual scowl rested upon her face, and it
was no pleasure to spend an hour in her
company. Her former friends stampeded when
they saw her approach.</p>

<p>I often tried to make her understand that at
the basis of all creation there was an universal
power, which has no name, but which men call
God, and which those who reject that term,
because they have formed a false conception of
that which is beyond all human conception,
might call by some other name, such as Love,
Reason, All-consciousness, Divine Wisdom, etc.,
and that she might feel the manifestation of
that power within her own soul, if she would
only pay attention to it.</p>

<p>“Prove it,” she cried. “Prove that I have
a soul, or that anybody has such a thing, and
which has never been discovered by science,
neither in the pineal gland nor in the big toe.
Show me that soul, and let me examine it, and I
will bottle it up and preserve it in the museum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Soul means life,” I replied. “How can
you know that you have a life, except by the
fact that you are living?”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!” exclaimed the princess.
“There is no such thing as life. What seems
life to you is only a phenomenon produced by
the mechanical action of brain molecules, the
result of indigestion.”</p>

<p>I was frightened to see the effects which my
premature revelation of the mysteries of science
had upon the princess. In vain I reminded
her of the sentiments which she formerly used
to have, and which were expressed in her song
in the cave at the time of our first meeting.
She called all these things “childish fancies,”
unworthy of the serious attention of science.
Alas! her study of the phenomenal side of
nature would not have been objectionable if
only her spiritual culture had not suffered by
that; but while her intellect grew strong by
overfeeding, her soul became starved to death;
neither would she listen to my admonitions;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
she could not realise the possession of anything
higher than the ever-doubting intellect, and this
was probably because she was only a gnome.</p>

<p>One day, when I actually thought her reason
was entirely gone, I said to her—</p>

<p>“Adalga, dear, do you know me?”</p>

<p>“Don’t dear me,” was her answer. “How
can you ask such a foolish question? I know
that I have an image of somebody on my
brain, and that its name is said to be Mulligan,
but whether your qualities correspond to that
image or not I have not yet discovered. For
all I know, the Mulligan with whom I fancy
myself to be acquainted may be only a product
of my own imagination.”</p>

<p>“It seems you love me no more?” I inquired
despondently.</p>

<p>“What is love but an effect of the imagination?”
she answered. “If I chose to fall in
love with a pitchfork, and bestow my affection
upon it, it will do me the same service as to
love Mr Mulligan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“I assure you,” I said, “true love is an
entirely different thing. That which you
describe is only some kind of fancy.”</p>

<p>“Prove it,” she exclaimed, as usual; but
alas! I could not prove to her that whose existence
she could not experience.</p>

<p>To make the matter short, Adalga became
so scientific as to lose all her loveliness of
form and character, and became overbearing,
ugly, conceited, and foolish, and the same was
the case more or less with all the rest of the
gnomes. The whole population became clever
and cunning, but, at the same time, lying and
hypocritical. Formerly they had been moved,
as it were, only by one will, namely, the will
of the king; now everybody wanted to rule
everybody else, and nobody rule himself or
be ruled by another. There was nothing
but quarrels, disputes, dissensions, dissatisfaction,
and selfishness; the gnomes lost their
perception of truth and their light. The
kingdom grew dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Formerly everything had been peaceful;
but now it became necessary to employ force
for the purpose of keeping order. Each gnome
cared only for his or her own interests, and
this caused fights. One of the first requirements
was the establishment of a police. I
soon found that the employees of the government,
including the police, could not be relied
upon. I therefore had to establish a corps
of detectives, and employ for that purpose the
greatest rascals, because it is known that “it
requires a thief to catch a thief.” These
detectives had again to be watched by others,
and from this ensued an universal espionage,
which was intolerable. Moreover, everybody
seeing himself continually watched, was
thereby continually reminded that it was in
his power to steal, and the end of it was that
the people considered it to be a great and
praiseworthy act if one succeeded in stealing
without getting caught.</p>

<p>At the time of my arrival it was the custom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
of the gnomes to believe everything that anybody
said, but now it became fashionable never
to believe anything whatever. The consequence
was that each believed the other a liar;
each mistrusted the other; nobody spoke the
truth, if it was not in his own interest to
do so. Nothing could be accomplished without
bribery; crimes became numerous, and it
became necessary to establish jails all over the
country.</p>

<p>There was one curious feature noticeable,
especially among the Sagani, who now constituted
the great autocratic body of scientists.
The more learned they became the more
narrow-sighted they grew. They lost the
power to open their eyes, and decided upon
every question according to hearsay and fancy.
Their limbs became atrophied, and their heads
swollen. Some became so big-headed and
top-heavy that they often lost their balance
and fell down. It was especially funny to see
how they tumbled about whenever one forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
himself, and by force of habit elongated his
body. Finally, narrow-sightedness became so
universal that a gnome without spectacles was
quite a curiosity, and it has been reported that
even children with spectacles upon their noses
were born; but of this I have no positive proof.</p>

<p>To my horror, the head of the princess grew
larger and stronger every day, and two hard
horn-like excrescences began to appear upon
it at the place where the phrenological bump of
love of approbation is located. At the same time
she grew exceedingly stubborn and vain. She
was continually surrounded by flatterers who
imposed upon her credulity. She could bear
no contradiction, and nevertheless craved for
disputes for the purpose of showing off her
great learning. She lost her former natural
dignity and self-esteem, and in its place she
acquired a great deal of false pride; but her
love of approbation revolted against the idea
that anybody might consider her vain, and for
the purpose of avoiding such a suspicion she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
joined gnomes of doubtful character, and went
into bad company.</p>

<p>Let me draw a veil over the history of these
sad events. Even now, although having
resumed my individuality as Mr Schneider, I
can look back only with deep regret upon the
change that overcame the charming princess
Adalga, owing to the ill-timed instruction of
Mr. Mulligan. As to her father, the king,
instead of comprehending the sad state of
affairs of his kingdom, he took a very superficial
view of it. He was delighted with the
intellectual progress of the princess, and with
the advancement of culture among his subjects,
and he overwhelmed me with tokens of favour,
calling me a public benefactor for civilising the
gnomes.</p>

<p>Bimbam I. did not care to enter himself into
the study of logic and elocution, nevertheless
he did not wish to be regarded as a fool. He
therefore tried to give himself an appearance
of being learned, and whenever his arguments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
failed, he became very irascible, and lost his
temper. He was excitable, but too great a
lover of comfort to remain long in an excited
state, and for this reason he was easily pacified.
Often he would get raving mad, bucking his
head against the walls; but a moment afterwards
he would go to smoke his pipe, as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>More and more the influence of the green
frog was felt spreading through the kingdom,
and there were some who claimed to have seen
him wandering about the streets, spreading
poisonous saliva from his mouth, from which
green and red-spotted toad-stools grew. The
world of the gnomes became continually more
unnatural and perverted; impudence assumed
the place of heroism, sophistry the mask of
wisdom, lecherousness passed for love, hypocrisy
paraded the streets under the garb of
holiness; those who succeeded in cheating all
the rest were considered the most clever; the
most avaricious gnomes were said to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
most prudent; he who made the greatest
noise was thought to be the most learned of
all. Nor were the ladies exempt from this
general degradation, for they assumed the
most ridiculous fashions, putting artificial
bumps on their backs and wearing tremendous
balloons in the place of sleeves; they lost
their simplicity, were full of affectations and
whims, and to do anything whatever in a plain
and natural way was considered vulgar.</p>

<p>But what is the use of continuing to
describe conditions which everyone knows
who has visited the Untersberg within the
last few years? It is sufficient to say that the
country of the gnomes at that time resembled
to a great extent the human-animal kingdom
of our days, and I would have wished to leave
it if I had not considered it my duty to
remain for the purpose of trying to undo some
of the mischief which had ignorantly been
caused by my prematurely opening the door
of the palace of Lucifer.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap">DARK and gloomy
grew the kingdom
of the
gnomes in proportion
as the light
of each individual
inhabitant decreased.
Many who
formerly were like luminous spheres, shedding
radiant rays to a considerable distance, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
became like dim will-o’-the-wisps, or merely
phosphorescent dots or firebugs. As the
general darkness increased, the glow that
came from the eyes of the green frog in
Lucifer’s temple, whose doors were now continually
open, became more visible, and at
certain times the frog actually seemed to be
alive.</p>

<p>The ghosts in the temple continued their
accustomed occupations without making any
progress whatever. The <i>perpetuum mobile</i>
was always on the point of completion, but
never completed; the bill of fare was continually
altered, but there was nothing to
eat; and the calculations made by the imaginary
heir produced no interest. All the ghosts
repeated the same follies again, which they
had been in the habit of enacting before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the work in the tunnel went on
with great speed, and the hole in the sky grew
deeper every night; but it was impossible to
say how long it would take to finish it, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
depth of the atmosphere which had to be
penetrated was not known. I estimated it to
be about one thousand miles, and calculating
the work at about five feet a night, I found
that the tunnel would be finished in 2924
years, which was rather a long time to wait
for the completion of my marriage.</p>

<p>Moreover, one very serious inconvenience
made itself perceptible. The working men
had become so big-headed as to render it
impossible for more than three gnomes to
work in the tunnel at the same time without
bumping their heads together. This delayed
the progress and caused fights, and the question
of widening the tunnel had to be taken
into consideration, which would necessarily
cause a considerable expense.</p>

<p>Already the country was groaning under
the heavy burden of an exorbitant taxation
required for the heads of science, who did the
hard work of thinking, for paying salaries to
professors, policemen, pensioners, supporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
prisoners and blind people, and especially for
supplying with luxuries the royal family and
their hangers-on. Especially the princess
required a great deal of cash for her support.
Her external appearance had become rather
uncanny, and she therefore needed costly
dresses and ornaments to hide her deformities.
Her head, having grown to an enormous size,
resembled the show-case of a jeweller’s shop,
being hung over with chains and jewels, while
a crown, or to speak more correctly, a tube of
gold, adorned her occiput for the purpose of
hiding the two horn-like excrescences.</p>

<p>I was one day consulting the king, and tried
to demonstrate to him the necessity of using
some economy and curtailing his private
expenses, as otherwise the whole country
would be involved in financial ruin; but I
found him quite unreasonable in that respect.</p>

<p>“I should like to know,” he exclaimed,
“what is the use of my being the king, if I
cannot get all the money I want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Everything,” I said, “belongs to your
majesty, but it will be to your own advantage
to see that the resources of the country are
not squandered, for, when the production
ceases, there will be no more income.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the king, “if the people refuse
to pay, I can still depend upon my army,
and we shall see.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment we were interrupted
by loud reports like explosions, following each
other in rapid succession. This was followed
by shouts and cries, and immediately afterwards
Cravatu came rushing into the palace,
and approaching the king, he said:</p>

<p>“May it please your majesty to take command
of the army. The labourers making the
hole in the sky have perforated the frontier of
the kingdom of the spirits of the air, and the
inhabitants offer resistance.”</p>

<p>The king, having still a certain amount of
perception of truth, did not get at all excited
upon hearing this news, but lighting his pipe,
he took a few whiffs, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“What about it? I do not blame them;
we can do nothing else but retire.”</p>

<p>Just then the princess entered, and, hearing
these words, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Rot! who ever heard of a king of the
gnomes being afraid of the spirits of the air?”</p>

<p>“I never,” replied the king.</p>

<p>“Well then,” continued Adalga, “we must
beat back the intruders, and force our way
through their kingdom.”</p>

<p>The king was easily influenced, especially
when his ambition was touched. Therefore
the words of the princess caused him to fly
into a rage. First he grew red in the face,
his features expanded from ear to ear like an
india-rubber bag. Next, he jumped several
feet from the ground and came down again
with a thump. After that he threw his pipe
upon the floor so that it broke, and stamped
upon it with his foot. Finally, he lowered
his head and butted it against Cravatu; and,
after all this was done, he began to yell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
crying at the top of his voice: “We must
drive the rascals away! We must force a
passage through them!”</p>

<p>A tumult was heard in the ante-room, and
directly numerous gnomes rushed in. They
were merchants and traders, and came to
make offers for furnishing supplies for the
army. They were under-bidding each other,
each offering to the king a greater bribe for
accepting his offer. The king accepted some of
the bargains which seemed to afford to him
the greatest profit for his private purse, and
the goods were delivered. They consisted of
barrels labelled “flour,” and filled with sand,
carloads of “leather shoes” made of paste-board,
wooden hams, and cartridges filled
with sawdust; also something that looked like
a cannon, but it was made of wood and
varnished, so as to give it the appearance of
bronze.</p>

<p>We left the palace, and the blowing of
horns indicated the locality of the combat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
On the way we met a train of wounded
gnomes, some exhibiting a pitiful aspect. All
the wounded had terrible burns and scalds,
and the limbs of some were torn away. One
poor fellow had lost the whole of his lower
jaw, which was dreadful to see, and he seemed
to suffer great pain.</p>

<p>“Why do not these people assume their
ethereal forms and thus get rid of their suffering
bodies?” I asked the minister.</p>

<p>“This art,” answered Cravatu, “is now
becoming very difficult, and there are very
few capable of exercising it, since we have
become so substantial. Moreover, these
people cannot do so at all; because it is
necessary for that purpose that one should
entirely forget his body, and how could we do
that, if the sensation of pain or of pleasure
keeps our attention fastened to it? For the
purpose of throwing off the mask of personality
and entering into the state of selflessness,
an entire forgetfulness of self is required, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
as is almost impossible to attain in our
present state of civilisation.”</p>

<p>The wounded we met became more numerous
as we approached the battle-field, and here
and there could be seen a corpse, stiff and
stark, slowly but surely evaporating. When
we arrived the explosions had already ceased,
and Clavo, the general in command, approached
upon a bicycle and made his report. From
this it appeared that in trying to enlarge the
tunnel, the labourers had entered into side-issues,
and by blowing out a large block of air,
made an opening into a foreign region of
unknown extent, which was inhabited by a
tribe of sylphs or fairies, unknown to science
and not yet classified. These spirits had
resented the intrusion, and prevented the
approach of our soldiers by pouring upon
them sheets of fluid lightning, with the most
destructive effect, so that all resistance was
rendered impossible, and they were forced to
retreat after experiencing a considerable loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“There is nothing to be done,” said the
general, after finishing his account, “but to
let these airy spirits alone and begin a new
tunnel in some other place. They are not of
an aggressive character, and will not molest us
if we go away. We have, anyhow, no right to
trespass upon their territory.”</p>

<p>“This is exactly what I always said,” the
king replied; “what business have we to
meddle with these good spirits? Let us go.”</p>

<p>But the princess interfered.</p>

<p>“Rot!” she cried: “Good spirits, indeed!
Let them be exterminated! Will your majesty
let them deprive us of our glory? Their
resistance is an insult to you!”</p>

<p>No words can express the pitch of rage to
which these words aroused the king. Growing
purple in the face and fairly screaming, he
elongated himself to three times his natural
size, and bumping his head against the wall,
as was his habit whenever he fell into a
passion, he cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“Let them be exterminated! Their resistance
is an insult to me! Kill them! Cut
off their heads!”</p>

<p>And falling down in an epileptic fit, owing
to the excessiveness of his fury, he stamped
with his feet, and kept on yelling, “Kill
them! Cut off their heads!”</p>

<p>I thought that perhaps the matter might be
settled in an amicable manner, and therefore I
told the king that rashness was not always
the best policy, and I asked for permission to
send a messenger, under the protection of a
flag of truce, to see whether or not a treaty could
be made with the spirits of the upper world.</p>

<p>“This is exactly what I always said,” replied
the king. “Rashness is not always the best
policy. We must send a messenger by all
means.”</p>

<p>Accordingly Cravatu and myself were appointed
to that office, and we went.</p>

<p>The undertaking was not without danger, as
the nature of the enemy and their habits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
thought were not known, and it was not at
all improbable that we should receive a shot
of lightning at our approach. However, we
arrived safely at the lower end of the tunnel,
and, looking up, we saw a great number of
blue lights moving above like a swarm of
bees.</p>

<p>Cravatu, putting his hands to his mouth,
shouted up through the hole:</p>

<p>“Peace be with you!”</p>

<p>We listened. The motion among the bees
increased, and after a while we heard a very
sweet music, as if of a silver harp and lute.
This was followed by a roll of thunder and a
flash of lightning, doing however no harm.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” I asked Cravatu,
and he replied:</p>

<p>“I perceive that these people speak a language
different from our own. They are
spirits of sound, and express their thoughts in
music. What they mean to say is that they
are peaceable, if we let them alone, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
they have the power to defend themselves if
we trouble them.”</p>

<p>“Prove it,” I involuntarily exclaimed, for I
had adopted instinctively the habit of the
princess, who wanted proofs for everything.</p>

<p>“It is not a matter for proving, but of
understanding,” answered Cravatu.</p>

<p>“But how are we going to reply?” I asked.
“Where can we find a dictionary of music,
and who is going to compose the music, or
fiddle it to them?”</p>

<p>Upon this Cravatu said:</p>

<p>“The language of music used to be known
to us as the music of nature. In olden times the
gnomes could understand it and speak it, and
required no dictionary for its interpretation,
because their simple minds understood that
simple language. But now we gnomes have
become so learned and scientific, and our minds
so complicated, that it is possible for hardly
anyone to understand a simple thing, or to
express himself in a simple manner. Fortunately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
I still find some knowledge of music in
my rapidly fading memory, but I cannot
answer in music. However, I know the language
of flowers, and this is also an universal
and natural language, somewhat akin to music,
and, if I am not mistaken, these spirits will
understand it.”</p>

<p>This ingenuity of Cravatu pleased me very
much. He was in fact still sound at heart,
one of the brightest of the gnomes, and in spite
of the progress of civilisation, in the midst of
which he moved, he had still a certain amount
of perception of truth, although on that very
account he was much exposed to the ridicule
of the scientists and made a target for their
wit, because they did not believe in such a
thing as intuition, and said that nobody could
know anything except by way of information,
inference, and by a trained imagination.</p>

<p>Cravatu now called some of the Acthnici,
who, by the mysterious power which they
possess, can create visible objects out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
invisible images existing everywhere in the
astral light, and ordered them to produce a
White Rose. This they did, and caused it to
float slowly up through the hole.</p>

<p>“What does this signify?” I asked, and
Cravatu answered—</p>

<p>“The White Rose asks: ‘May I approach
you?’”</p>

<p>We waited awhile, when down through
the tunnel floated an Euphorbia. We saw it
plainly, and had ample time to examine it;
but at the moment when it touched the earth
it vanished. This flower Cravatu interpreted
as being intended to say—</p>

<p>“Why do you persecute us?”</p>

<p>Up went a Heliotrope to tell them—</p>

<p>“My heart longs for you.”</p>

<p>And the answer came back in the shape of a
Belladonna, indicating—</p>

<p>“We do not credit the honesty of your
intentions.”</p>

<p>To this we replied by sending up a White<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Lily for the purpose of testifying to the purity
of our affection, whereupon we received a
Violet bidding us—</p>

<p>“Hope!”</p>

<p>Up again went a Daffodil, to ask them not
to be so cruel as to let us pine away in hopeless
misery, and we waited.</p>

<p>A consultation seemed to take place among
the bees. A great number of small lights were
seen to gather around a large blue light in the
middle, and a melodious humming was heard.
Directly a leaf of a Fern floated down, bringing
the answer—</p>

<p>“I will meet you,” and in return we sent up
a Geranium to inform them that we were
waiting.</p>

<p>Soon after that a clear and beautiful accord
was heard, and something luminous floated
down through the tunnel, which I could not
describe otherwise than as being an oval-shaped
radiance of an exquisite rose-coloured
light, composed of living sound, and emitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
harmonious accords, like an Æolian harp.
When it issued from the mouth of the tunnel,
I perceived within its sphere the ethereal shape
of an Oleander blossom, in the midst of which
appeared the childlike and smiling face of a
most charming fairy. These were then the
spirits of flowers.</p>

<p>Cravatu presented the fairy with a Jessamine
blossom as a token of friendship, and invited
her to accompany us to the king.</p>

<p>An accord, indicating consent, was the
answer, and we returned with the fairy in our
midst.</p>

<p>“Bring the prisoner!” exclaimed Adalga,
assuming an air of scientific arrogance, when
she saw us approaching. This rudeness
offended me, and I said:</p>

<p>“This is not a prisoner, princess, but an
ambassador coming to us, upon our invitation,
and under the flag of truce. It is a fairy of
high descent, and the law of justice demands
that she be treated respectfully.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Prove it!” answered the princess angrily.</p>

<p>“Justice,” I said, “is not a thing to be
proved, but to be practised.”</p>

<p>While I spoke, the Oleander blossom gave
forth a sweet melody of harmonious sounds,
but Adalga looked at the fairy with a wicked
glance in her eye, and said:</p>

<p>“A curious specimen, which we must not
let escape. It will be quite an ornament to
our museum.”</p>

<p>“It will be no such thing,” I answered
indignantly. “This noble fairy is under my
protection, and I shall protect her.”</p>

<p>But the princess retorted in a haughty
manner:</p>

<p>“The interests of science are first of all to
be taken into consideration. It may not be
strictly correct, in a legal sense, to retain the
prisoner, but the end justifies the means.”</p>

<p>To this the king added:</p>

<p>“I always told you so; the end justifies the
means.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Upon this Adalga made a vicious grab at
the Oleander blossom, trying to capture it, but
did not succeed; for the rose-coloured radiance
at once became transformed into a column of
red vapour, which whirled away, while from
its interior came a discordant sound indicative
of disappointment and sorrow.</p>

<p>The princess flew into a rage, and elongating
her body to the full length, struck at the
column of vapour, but only to fall upon her
nose, for the red cloud had already passed
beyond her reach. We followed the fairy, but
could only see the rose-coloured light floating
back into the tunnel, where it disappeared, and
after a little while a mournful strain of music
was heard. We sent up a variety of flowers
with a hope of renewing the negotiations;
but they were not accepted. We received
nothing but a rain of ashes, indicating that
all prospects for an amicable understanding
were at an end.</p>

<p>This failure to catch the spirit of sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
caused to the princess a great deal of vexation,
and she blamed us for not having closed up
the mouth of the tunnel to prevent the return
of the fairy. To this I replied:</p>

<p>“There is a certain amount of honour even
among thieves; but to a person absorbed by a
greed for gratifying his scientific curiosity in
regard to that which belongs to the higher life,
nothing is inviolable or sacred, and nothing
safe from his attempts to uselessly and foolishly
cause its destruction. Too clumsy, stupid, and
cowardly to try to rise up to a conception of
high and exalted ideals, those would-be scientists
and pseudo-philosophers would like to
entice those ideals, allure them by false
promises, and drag them down into the
manure in which they themselves love to
roll; but thanks to the laws of the eternal
spirit in nature, true goodness cannot be
approached by evil, wisdom is not comprehensible
to the fool, and purity does not
amalgamate with filth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“Prove it!” she cried, probably more from
force of habit than as a result of reflection;
for some remnant of reason left in her
mind seemed to make her feel the idiocy of
her requests, and, changing the subject, she
said:</p>

<p>“Who is it that has caused me to pry with
curious eyes behind the veil of the unknown,
and to strive to outstrip my own natural
growth. Who caused the loss of my light,
my beauty and purity, destroyed my ideals,
and made me a slave to doubt? Who, but you
yourself, has caused me to treat reason with
contempt, to become blind through vanity,
and deformed by scepticism? Who, but you,
has presented us with a knowledge of evil,
which to overcome we have not become strong
enough? Who, but you, took away our
power, by causing us to expend it in channels
that did not belong to our true nature? You
caused us to lose our ethereal state, so that now
we have to creep like worms upon the earth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
instead of sailing like eagles through space on
wings of freedom, as was the custom of our
race before you arrived. Now the hellish
work has begun and it shall be finished, let
the cost be what it may. The end must be
made to justify the means.”</p>

<p>The determined and clear manner in which
Adalga spoke pleased me very much; it
proved to me that there was still a lingering
spark of reason in her. It was as if the falling
upon her nose had awakened her finer sensibilities,
and I was about to enter into a discussion
of philosophical questions with her;
but she would not listen. Turning to the
king, she requested him to declare war immediately
to the superior kingdom, to force
its doors open, and to select the best troops
for making the assault.</p>

<p>“You are the ruler of the world,” she said
to the king. “You are great and wise. No
one will dare to resist you.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered the king, being much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
tickled by her flattering words, and assuming
an air of self-importance. “I am the ruler of
the world. I am great and wise. No one will
dare to resist me. I will exterminate the
spirits of the superior kingdom.”</p>

<p>The troops were gathered, and of each division
the best individuals selected for making
the first assault under the command of Clavo;
but now a great difficulty presented itself at
the very start; for even the common people
among the gnomes had become so much accustomed
to arguing, that not a soldier would
obey an order without having all the “whys”
and “wherefores” explained to him. Each
private wanted to know why this or that
order was given, and whether it would be
advisable to follow it, and what it was intended
for, and whether not perhaps something
better might be done, and so forth.
This caused an endless delay; because, for the
purpose of obtaining the consent of the subordinates
to follow an order, the commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
general had to explain his views and argue his
points with the officers; the officers had to
reason it out with the corporals, and they in
their turn had to discuss it with the privates
and obtain their consent. Some thought the
given order practicable, others made objections
and refused to obey, and nobody could be induced
to act against his own views. From
this state of affairs there arose a great deal of
delay, difficulties, and waste of time; but at
last the assault was made.</p>

<p>They were driven back with great loss, and
others took their places, but with the same
result. The most obstinate gnomes were sent
forward, and for two nights lasted the battle,
in which wonderful deeds of stubbornness and
daring were accomplished, with no other effect
than bringing destruction upon the gnomes
and doing no harm to the fairies, whose stronghold
was inaccessible; for whenever our
soldiers rushed up through the tunnel, a single
effusion of lightning was sufficient to kill the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
greater portion of them, while the rest were
driven back mutilated and scorched.</p>

<p>Thus the flower of the kingdom of the
gnomes was destroyed; the wails of the widows
and orphans resounded, and the king wept unceasingly,
beating the air with his arms in
sheer despair and impotent fury. Nevertheless,
owing to the persuasions of the princess,
the gnomes would not desist. She made the
king believe that, according to her theory
about the exhaustion of energy, the lightning
power of the fairies could not endure very
long, and the king believed all she said.</p>

<p>“If we cannot go up to them,” she said,
“we must make them come down.” To this
end she instituted sham flights among the
troops, hoping to induce the elfs to pursue
them, and she tried all possible means for
beguiling the inhabitants of the upper realm,
and lead them into a trap. She made to them
all kinds of false promises, but those spirits
saw that her motive was not pure; she tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
to attract them by her song, but her voice
had become harsh and disagreeable, like the
screeching of an owl.</p>

<p>In fact, I must confess it, although it may
not be considered nice to speak ill of a lady,
especially if she is one’s intended wife, that
Adalga had become somewhat disagreeable.
This war brought out the worst traits of her
character, and no means were too contemptible
for her to employ, provided they held out a
prospect to her for accomplishing what she
desired.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that, at the time
which corresponded to day in our world, the
gnomes fell into a death-like sleep, from which
they did not awaken until night settled upon
the earth. Not being a gnome, I was not subject
to the law of their nature, but could remain
awake and observe what was taking place
during their sleep.</p>

<p>Thus, during the third day after the beginning
of the struggle, I was lying awake in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
camp, while all the gnomes were asleep. I was
watching the entrance of the tunnel, which
appeared like a circular opening in the clouds,
through which issued a faint light, when suddenly
it became illumined by a roseate
radiance of great beauty, somewhat like the
<i>aurora borealis</i> or northern light. At the
same time I heard a chant as of angel voices,
and directly afterwards there issued from the
tunnel a bevy of the most charming fairies,
each representing a luminous living flower,
with a beautiful face in its midst. There were
Oleanders, Orange-Blossoms, Roses, Camelias,
Anemones, Pansies, Forget-me-nots, Daffodils,
etc., and out of the chalice or heart of each
looked a childlike face, peaceful and smiling;
but the greatest and most radiant of all was a
white Lotus flower, in whose midst dwelt the
fairy queen, with a crown of diamonds upon
her head.</p>

<p>I was not at all alarmed. I saw—if I am
permitted to use such an unscientific expression—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
they intended no harm. It would have
been useless to attempt to awaken the sleeping
gnomes; I therefore remained still, and looked
at the spirits of the flowers through my half-closed
lids. They moved about among the
sleepers, singing and scattering blossoms, and
when they came to the place where Adalga
slept, they drew around her in a circle, throwing
flowers upon her, such beautiful ones as I
had never seen before, and which did not fade
away either, when they touched the ground;
but the princess smiled in her sleep, as if she
had a pleasant dream, and her features assumed
an expression that made her look agreeable in
spite of her ugliness.</p>

<p>The fairies stood regarding the sleeper with
great attention, while pity and hope were expressed
in their faces, and the Lotus flower
stepped out of her chalice, and sang in a
silvery voice a song in a language which
I did not understand literally, but whose
sentiments became clear to my heart, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
might perhaps be expressed in the following
lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Thus the queen of the Lotus ended her song,
and floated away with her companions. The
last I saw of them was a roseate light shining
from the mouth of the tunnel. I then fell
asleep myself, and slept until I was awakened
by the blowing of horns, the blast of trumpets,
and beating of drums, calling the troops
together for a renewal of the fight, and those
who were so inclined got up and joined the
ranks.</p>

<p>I went to the princess, and found her to be
in a pensive mood, while her loquaciousness
was less than usually active—a circumstance
which I attributed to the visit of the fairies.
I asked her whether she had experienced a
pleasant dream.</p>

<p>“I do not believe in dreams,” she answered.
“Scientists never attribute any importance to
dreams or to subjective experiences; our
attention is fully engaged by the objective
realities of life.”</p>

<p>“Confound your false science!” I said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
“It deals, after all, with nothing but appearances
and dreams. The fairies seemed to me
very objective.”</p>

<p>“So you saw them?” replied Adalga.
“Perhaps it was your thought-transfer which
caused that hallucination.”</p>

<p>“Let it be what it may,” I said. “It is of
little importance from what we receive a
lesson; the lesson itself is that which we ought
to consider.”</p>

<p>“We are not in the habit of accepting
lessons,” she answered, “unless they come
from some well-recognised authority.”</p>

<p>To this I answered:</p>

<p>“Truth is truth, no matter by whom it is
uttered.”</p>

<p>“Prove it!” exclaimed the princess, and as
I remained silent, she continued, sneeringly:
“If we are asked to listen to a theory, the
first thing is to inquire about the claims for
credibility of him who puts them forth. Upon
what authority does his assertion rest? What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
books can he quote for the support of his
opinion? If all this is settled, we may listen
to his proofs, and decide whether we will
accept them or not.”</p>

<p>I groaned. “Alas!” I said; “in your
science it is all creed, but no perception of
truth.”</p>

<p>Off she went, and soon cries of distress were
heard between the explosions that followed.
The storming party was beaten back. A fresh
attack was ordered, but the troops had become
disheartened, and refused to enter the tunnel.
Some, however, were inclined to proceed, and
called the others cowards; and this led to a
quarrel among the troops, which resulted in a
fight, and the fight developed into an open
revolt, during which it soon became plain that
the mutineers were in great strength. In vain
the king butted his head against everything
that happened to come in his way, in vain the
princess proved by irrefutable arguments that
the loyal troops could not be conquered; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
were beaten anyhow, and we were driven back
with them in the direction of Lucifer’s temple.
Soon after that we were pressed so hard that
we had to seek shelter behind the walls.
Multitudes thronged in after us, and many
more sought to enter, but could find no room.
The space became so crowded that the gnomes
pushed each other, and struggled for room.
Thus they pressed against the pedestal of the
queen frog, some climbing upon it, others
trying to climb; and in the midst of the uproar
the monster began to sway, and, losing its
balance, it fell.</p>

<p>A crash followed. The frog was broken to
pieces, and volumes of poisonous vapour coming
from the phosphorus filled the place. Instinctively
I closed my eyes, and when I opened
them again the whole assembly of gnomes had
become transformed into animals. Bimbam I.
had turned into an ox, rushing madly through
the crowd; in the place of the commanding
general stood a sheep; and, to my horror, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
beheld a big goat in the place of the princess.
Cravatu had become a black lizard, with yellow
spots, and all the rest of the gnomes now
appeared in animal forms. There were bats
flying about, mice rushing into holes, spiders
crawling over the walls; and two ministers,
having turned into brass beetles, were rolling
a ball of dirt over the ground. Cats squalled,
rats whistled, frogs croaked, sheep bleated,
dogs yowled and barked, and the whole was
in a terrible confusion.</p>

<p>The goat stared at me in an offensive
manner, which I was bound to resent. So I
said:</p>

<p>“You need not stare at me in this manner.
Is this your gratitude for my conferring upon
you the blessings of civilisation? Is this the
thanks which I am to receive from you for
teaching you logic, and how to draw inferences
from postulates? To you we owe all this misfortune.
It is your confounded curiosity that
made you meddle with things for whose conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
you were not mature, and which
you could not realise, that brought about this
war. The stubbornness with which you kept
clinging to your preconceived opinions has
caused this mutiny. Now you have turned
into a goat, and I can only say it served you
right.”</p>

<p>The goat tried to speak, but brought forth
only a stuttering “ma-a-a-h,” which sounded
to me like the ironical laughter of a scientist
of old laughing at the rotundity of the
earth.</p>

<p>The princess—that is to say, the goat—lowered
her head.</p>

<p>“You need not get angry!” I exclaimed,
feeling somewhat alarmed. “You ought to be
ashamed of yourself. I wish that I had never
seen you. I am only sorry that it is I who is
to be married to a goat.”</p>

<p>But before I had time to finish this sentence,
the goat made a vicious rush at me, and gave
me a butt on my stomach which took my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
breath. I grasped the princess by her horns,
and a struggle ensued.</p>

<p>Just then I heard somebody yell in an unearthly
manner, and recognised the voice as
that of Professor Cracker. In a moment the
situation became perfectly clear to me, and I
was no longer Mulligan, but Mr Schneider.
Jeremiah Stiffbone was close to me, calling
upon somebody to have pity upon his soul;
and from under him there came forth a series
of indefinite grunts, in which I recognised Mr
Scalawag’s voice. The goat escaped, and I
knew that we still were in that hole in the
Untersberg, near the Dragon’s Den, and that
my adventure among the gnomes had been
only a dream.</p>

<p>The rest may easily be imagined. The subterranean
passage, into which we had entered
for obtaining shelter, had another outlet upon
the other side of the hill, and through that a
herd of goats had come in for some purpose;
but the rest of one of them had been rudely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
disturbed by the foot of Professor Cracker.
No serious harm, however, was done, while the
experience was not without scientific value, as
it proved that the goat was very spirited—a
circumstance that might be regarded as going
to show that there was some spirit after all in
that goat. This theory I, however, advance
merely as a working hypothesis, leaving it to
the reader to use his own judgment as to
whether he will accept it as wholly true, or
only in part.</p>

<p>Thus Mr Schneider’s story ended, and
nothing has been heard publicly of the gnomes
ever since. It is even believed that they keep
their doors locked against all reformers. But,
in commemoration of the event described, a
board has been put up in the Dragon’s Den,
upon which a representation of the encounter
between the committee and the spirit of that
goat has been roughly painted by an amateur
artist; and below the picture there is a description
of the adventure in doggerel verse, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
caused me a great deal of trouble to translate,
but which might be rendered in English as
follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Stop, wanderer, and behold with silent contemplation,</div>
<div class="verse">How exact science fought interior revelation.</div>
<div class="verse">The cleverest thing that Cracker had invented</div>
<div class="verse">Was by a stupid goat, with her two horns resented.</div>
<div class="verse">Alas! such is the fate of all the would-be wise;</div>
<div class="verse">We only know for sure that which we realise.”</div>
